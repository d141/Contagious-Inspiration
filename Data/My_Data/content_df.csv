Yeah it sucks, I just got dumped a couple weeks ago too, but dwelling on it just makes it worse. Maybe they weren't really right for you anyways. Don't smoke to get rid of the pain, smoke to celebrate what comes next! New and exciting adventures await all of you. Toke on fellow ents."

Edit: Holy crap - just checked in and there are a ton of questions already. I'll start early.

Edit 2: WOW, I am totally overwhelmed by all of your compliments. I can't tell you how much this all means to me, because I fangirl over reddit like the rainbow-barfing kitty cat that I am. Seeing my name on the frontpage will seriously be one of the highlights of my career.

I'm going to check out for a while, but i'll come back later tonight or tomorrow and try to answer as many questions as possible. THANK YOU all.

** back to mixing the new album. thank you all for the q&a, we had fun! -sr"
17,"Hey all, 2012 was a good year in game music and geeky music, and as such there may have been some albums which passed under the radar. Do any of you guys have an album released in the last year which you loved, but you think didn't get much attention? Or maybe you just have something you want to evangelize about? Let me hear them. I'm going to compile some of them in a blog post on 8BitX as well, so keep an eye out.

I should give you a few suggestions, to be fair. Quid pro quo, so here you go:

[SOUNDSHOCK 2: FM FUNK TERROR](http://vgmdb.net/album/32361) - Original Sega Genesis-style chiptune funk compilation that will spontaneously bedeck you with the coolest of shades.

[Cities in Motion](http://vgmdb.net/album/33085) - The game came out in previous years, but the album became available for purchase this year, SO: unrelentingly fun and relaxing ambient music, jazz, and goodvibes for your work day.

[Fastfall: Dustforce OST](http://vgmdb.net/album/31351) - The game itself never reached the same (unparalleled) popularity of Super Meat Boy, but it's a good'un. The soundtrack is equally formidable, and shows off a wide range of lo-fi chiptune, dance, ambient, and industrial sounds.

[NES Jams](http://vgmdb.net/album/31947) - Shnabubula wrecks your face with NES piano covers. You are not prepared.

So what did I miss? If you can link to a (legal) download or streaming page, you'll be my new favorite internet friend. "

19,"I still recommend buying it, but like many fans who aren't very patient like myself I couldnt help but try to get my Foals fix and boy was I not disappointed. Leaked a month early the album has 11 tracks ranging from heavy to funky and even some slow. Nothing new for Foals to change it up, this album was everything I expected/wanted it to be. Just pure unadulterated bliss. Anyone else also listen to it yet? Whats your verdict? I cant wait for my vinyl copy to come in."

21,"I've been thinking a lot about prominence lately, and how we measure it. I feel like the ways we measure it now aren't very satisfying... a mountain can look really prominent from most directions, but have one nearby peak that really reduces its prominence. 

So, a couple questions:

Can you think of good examples of mountains that look really prominent from one angle, but not from another? I'm thinking a mountain on the edge of a big range or something like that. The best example I can think of right now the the Mt Bowlen in Banff - really prominent from many angles, but right near Mount Little so doesn't have much prominence in our metrics.

Do you think the ways that people measure prominence right now are any good? "
22," And a further question to consider: What should we be willing to give up to obtain it?

25,"As /r/IAmA has grown, we have had the opportunity to question a lot of interesting people. A big part of what draws these people is the great atmosphere here which can be both fun and informative at the same time. Keeping both comments and posts at a high-level of quality is essential to establishing credibility and legitimacy as a serious place to interview. As more and more people hear about having good experiences with the subreddit, we get more and more interesting AMAs. However, as the subreddit grows, comments and voting can become unruly and out of control, which disrupts the all-welcoming atmosphere that we should be projecting. So, in order to try to maintain this environment as a place where all sorts of people (even controversial ones) can come and share, we have drawn up an IAmA-specific version of Reddiquette in order to encourage discussion and ensure quality. This will be posted [in our wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/wiki) for everyone to see, and we would really appreciate your thoughts on what we can add and how it can be improved. 

---

1. You should vote on comments from users based on:
---

* **The value of the question**: Questions should be original and on topic. They aren’t required to be, but AMAs are a unique opportunity and it is sad to squander them by asking 100 iterations of “if you could fight 1 horse sized duck or 100 duck sized horses.” Please try to encourage thought-provoking, discussion-inspiring questions that OP would not likely be asked anywhere else.

* **Civility and Politeness**: users are free to (and encouraged to) ask tough questions. But this should be done in a respectful and polite way. There’s no need to use harsh language, and a comment that treats the OP like a person is much more likely to be answered.

* **Asking for Proof**: having legitimate posts is vital to maintain the integrity of /r/iama, and makes it much easier for everyone to see the legitimacy of the post.

* You should downvote **insults and rude behavior** (“Fuck you because X”). This is not to say that you shouldn’t ask tough questions. But do it in a civil, polite matter, no matter how much you disagree with them. The OP took the time to come and share their thoughts, and they shouldn’t be harassed for doing so.

* You should downvote **non-questions and other  “substanceless” comments** that don’t make an interesting point or ask a good question (Ex: “I love you!”, “No questions, just wanted to say hi”). This also applies to child comments and reply to the OP. Followup questions, remarks on their answers, etc. are all encouraged, but jokes and puns should not be. 

* You should downvote **joke questions** that aren’t intended to get a real answer, especially in threads where the OP probably won’t be able to respond to everyone. For example, “Do you even lift?” in every single AMA about athletics.

* You should downvote **attempts to back the OP into a corner**; asking tough questions is fine, but don’t specifically try to put them into an uncomfortable or awkward position. This is a place to get information and learn about someone else’s opinions, not score points or further your own agenda. 

---

2. You should vote on an OP’s comments based on:
---

* **A response that addresses the question(s) being asked**: The OP’s answer is pretty much always relevant to the discussion (it is their topic, after all) and it should rarely be downvoted, even if you disagree with what they say.
* **A thorough and detailed answer**: If the OP is just using one-word answers or giving flippant responses, then feel free to downvote them. The answers in Woody Harrelson’s AMA are a great example of this: if the OP doesn’t answer a question well, then feel free to downvote it
* **Good humor and playing along** with friendly banter

* **If you disagree with the OP’s opinion, offer a reply with your reasoned thoughts**. This way, you can open a dialogue with op and potentially debate the differing points of view.  This is much better than than downvoting, which just hides the comment from being seen by anyone and makes the AMA harder to navigate.

---

3. Voting on IAmAs
---

* **Whether the OP has interesting information or experiences**, regardless of your personal opinion of that person or their experiences. The Westboro Baptist Church is a good example; even if you vehemently disagree with their viewpoint, they still have a very uncommon perspective to share. Downvoting the OP just cause you disagree with them will only result in an undesirable atmosphere and will likely end up with OP ending the AMA early, or not put effort into answering questions. Rather than downvoting, which just hides the comment from being seen by anyone, offer a reply with your reasoned thoughts. This way, you can open a dialogue with op and potentially debate the differing points of view.

* Upvote for **providing proof in the post**. If there is no proof, ask for it! If the OP ignores requests for proof, or just dismisses it, then report it to the mods. 

* Once it has started, **how they are responding to questions overall**. If you feel that they are only here to plug a product and didn’t take the time to interact with the community, then feel free to downvote it. 

---

4. Voting on Requests
---

* **Whether it would be a good AMA if it were fulfilled**. See above for those qualities

* **Whether the OP could provide proof if it were fulfilled**. Often requests are posted for things that would be impossible to verify. You can also make more specific requests: for example, instead of “AMA request, a murderer” you could request “AMA, someone who has been convicted of murder,” because then they would have court documents as proof. 

* **How likely it is that an AMA would happen**. Generally, requesting one specific person is difficult, but you can improve your chances by providing a way to contact that person, like their twitter account. Requests are more likely to be fulfilled if you’re requesting a group of people rather than just one in particular

* Upvote **requests which have included at least 5 questions** which are relevant to the person being requested. If these are not present, please report the post and message the mods!

* downvote **repeat requests**, which are already on the front page or have been recently. Try and point them to the relevant requests if you can.

Yes, we already posted this. We are posting it again because this is the only way we can bring attention to proper voting procedures. "

For the sake of the hypothetical, let's say that you have a very, very large disposable income. Prior to you receiving any cash, all your investments, savings, taking care of dependents, charitable donations and so on have been taken care of. There is absolutely no need for you to work, ever again, if you didn't want. 

What would be the first thing you would do? After you had gotten over the initial buzz, what would your life look like, how would you fill your time? 

EDIT - extra things to think about. Where would you live? What would you drive? If someone asked you 'what you did', what might you say in return? If you have children, how might you explain to them what you did? How would this affect your relationships? "

37,"Long time lurker, first time poster here. 

After years and years of attempting to count calories, diet, exercise, you name it, I sit here at my heaviest and unhappiest to date. I've been doing a ton of reading and research on this subreddit (and the interwebz in general), and I thought I would begin my journey by committing to it with a post. 

I've been overweight since getting my first desk job after high school (about 2004). Right now I'm tipping the scales at 233lbs (I'm a 6' female). My goal is to get down around 170 (this was my weight at the end of high school, and also as skinny as I'd like to be given my height). I'm getting married on NYE this year, and I want to look and feel great for my day!

I'm sick of feeling so unhealthy. I'm sick of feeling tired all the time, of never feeling satisfied. I'm sick of the terrible back pain I feel every day from my degenerative disc disease, and I'm sick of doctors poking and prodding and not helping. I'm 28 years old and it physically hurts me to bend and tie my shoes - I am not okay with accepting this as my life any longer. 

I truly believe Keto will be the solution I need. I know it will be hard, but I need a true lifestyle change. I want to set an example for my mother (who is also overweight and unhappy) and prove to her that it can be done. I want to keep up with my marathon-running fiance when we go for walks and hikes. I want to feel good about my body for the first time in...well....ever. I want to be proud of the choices I am making for my health and I want to instill these priorities in the children I hope to have in the coming years. 

Tonight I go grocery shopping, armed with a Keto-focused grocery list, and the journey starts as soon as I wake up. 

I hope I am okay to post this here, and thank you for reading if you've survived my wall of text. For those of you who have had success, please pass along any helpful tips for those first couple (and inevitably challenging) weeks. I'd love to hear your stories, your successes and failures, and really anything you'd like to share. And I also want to thank you all for inspiring me to take this step. "
38,"Hi guys, looking for some ideas/advice. After 17 years loyal service, I'm going to be made redundant next month. I have a fair amount of savings to keep me going while I figure out what I want to do next, but I think I'll also have around 50k as a lump sum to invest. Rent is cheap enough and I plan to live as frugally as possible to stretch my savings out. Job-wise, I'll either look for the same again,  retrain/re-skill, or try my hand at something completely different.  I'm 47 and not much of a risk taker these days, so was looking for the best way to make the most of this ""windfall"" . Any ideas/advice would be really appreciated.

So why is it considered irresponsible to observe the Gospels and not Revelation, or to accept the Exodus, but not Leviticus? Freedom of religion is the ability to distinguish what people wish to believe, right?

And furthermore, we know the Bible was not all written at one time, or by the same people, so picking and choosing seems like a far more logical course of action than all out fundamentalism right? "

62,"Back in college, my friend and I had a routine. We had an 8 a.m. class together, and I had to drive to work after, so I'd pick him up at his place, and groggy, we'd attempt Spanish. 

He lived downtown, across from the jail, and that year, Valentine's Day must have fallen on a Sunday. His yard was littered with oversized construction paper hearts and poster boards with ""I LOVE YOU DADDY!"" scrawled in a child's hand.

""What's with the Valentine's?"" I asked. 

""Must have been visiting day at the jail yesterday,"" he said. ""Afterward, the moms and kids stood in the yard and waved up to the dads. Kids are all dressed up. They hold up the signs, then they left them, so the guys can still see them, I guess.""

""Oh,"" I said, not sure if it was this was the sweetest or most depressing display I'd ever heard of. 

Valentine's Day is one of those crappy holidays that's not a big deal, until it is a big deal.

Back when I was dating my soon-to-be husband, and I worked in an office, he sent flowers on Valentine's Day. These flowers he'd pick were gorgeous, excessive. I'm not really an excessive kind of gal, but dear god there is something lovely about getting the most beautiful bouquet in the office. It vanquishes all the times you never got a lousy carnation in high school when the Student Council delivered flowers to each classroom. It was a Valentine's Day fundraiser, but it should have been called, Today-Is-Popularity-Contest-Day-And-You-Lose.  

Flowers like that make you beam for a week, make the other girls a little green around the gills, make the men look a little sheepish that they didn't think to get a bouquet for their women.

Sometimes, that man of mine would have flowers delivered to me for no reason at all. My coworkers would grin and say, ""Your boyfriend must be in the doghouse. What'd he do wrong?""

And I'd say, ""Nothing. Not one thing.""

The relationship aged, as they do, and when I started working at home, the flowers stopped. No problem. 

A couple of years ago, after I gave him a card and some little knickknack, he realized he'd forgotten it was Valentine's Day. He sprung up from the couch with some awkward excuse about running out. He returned with a Walgreen's bag, trying to hide it from me. 

Inside was a box of stale Fannie May's and an unsigned card. 

For all the nonsense that Valentine's is, it did become the one day of the year when I let myself indulge in the pleasure of picking through a box of chocolates, trying to decide if raspberry-filled are superior to truffles. 

The next couple of years, he didn't forget, though he'd always tease that the chocolates he'd bought were ""hardly stale at all."" He purchased them from the Fannie May store, wonderful, fresh chocolates that satisfied my sweet tooth and subtly said, ""I care about you."" 

So today is Valentine's Day, and my husband is having some kind of an emotional crisis. It's too long and confusing to explain here, but he's working out of town. 

I'm not even sure if he'll call today. I love him so. I'm not sure if he loves me back. I'm not sure if he knows if he loves me. 

And I am sitting here trying to find love in the memory-scent of flowers delivered to my office ages ago, wishing he would walk though the door with a box of stale chocolates.

I know that won't happen. All I can do is stand in this yard, looking up at the emotional jail he is imprisoned in with a giant heart that reads, ""I LOVE YOU SWEETIE.""  

I hope he looks down. I hope he knows I am wishing him a Happy Valentine's Day. 
 
I hope he comes back to me. 

EDIT: Some kind comments, some nice upvotes, and Gold from one of you out there. Thank you for making me smile. Happy Valentine's Day to you.

64,"Some 90 Days ago I PMOd, and felt very unsatisfied.  I was left staring at a luminescent picture, and I couldn't help but wonder what I was doing with my life.  Almost twelve months had passed since I last got laid.

Since that PMO, there has been much struggling.  NoFap is an ever-present battle that has profoundly beneficial effects on the mind.  During the twelve months that I had not been intimate with anyone else, people had tried to get involved with me.  Every one of them failed to meet my expectations, because I was used to seeing everything and anything I desired on-screen.  /r/iasip/ had a great picture of Mac with a caption stating ""Maybe if you drop your standards a little, you will get laid more"".  It's true, and it's great too.  Since quitting porn I am so easily aroused by people, and everybody is beautiful.  Blemishes are present on every person, and that's ok, in fact it's fucking beautiful how imperfect we all are.

Without porn I've engaged in a healthy sexually active lifestyle with two girls.  Neither of them wants a serious relationship, and we all have busy lives with jobs and hobbies and friends.  Every now and again I can meet up with one of them, and we treat each other like the most beautiful person on the planet.  My two girl buddies aren't pretty, and I'm not either, we're just natural healthy people treating each other like we need to be treated from time to time.

Sometimes temptation crops up, in the form of an underwear advert on a bus, or a gonewild post on the front page.  Not giving in gets tough.  But I get tougher every time the feeling comes along.  Temptation is just a distraction from the real task at hand.  Whatever needs to be done will still need to be done unless I do it.  Giving in to the PMO urge means that I will not only be delayed from completing my task, but my partners will also be cheated of the libido my body has so carefully been preparing for them.

None of this would have been possible without NoFap.  Knowing that so many other amazing people have battled with the PMO urge is a constant source of comfort.  Someone once told me that sorrow shared is half sorrow, and joy shared is double joy.  This subreddit has provided me with almost limitless support, and I will be forever grateful.  Float On Fapstronauts, the world is your oyster. 

TLDR; Gave up on Fapping.  Discovered the joy of lowering standards for partnering.  Feeling Fine.  Thank You NoFap!"
65,"I took a break of a week and a half, and although I felt fine, I was frustrated beyond explanation by everything. My frustrations lead me to try smoking again, this time with more control. This is where things got ugly, and it wasn't the first time. Blood pressure drops, pain in left side of chest, shaking, chills, I'm about to faint, I feel so week I'm slurring my speech. The whole time I'm thinking to myself, ""this isn't the first time this has happened..""

I have no idea why I cannot smoke weed any more. I do not even feel high, I feel like I'm going to die. One day this just happened, and wouldn't stop happening. No amount of breaks, or changes in my lifestyle have helped except quitting. 

For the first time I'm not longer quitting, I am officially quit. It is behind me. I look at it next to me right now, and all I feel is fear of it, fear that it will make me sick, fear it will make me fall into the same trap again.

The best advice I can give anyone here is to really understand the difference between quitting and being done forever. Learn from my mistakes, don't put yourself in a position where you need to fear for you life before you finally gain some clarity and understand that quitting weed is the wrong verbiage, and that what you really need to do is start a whole new chapter in your life without it. Just sit and meditate, figure out what I am explaining to you. If you have been trying to quit, stop listening to your head, and start listening to your body. It is your body driving you to quit smoking, not things like money, motivation, your girlfriend, or a job. These things do not really help you quit, listening to your body does. 

Goodbye frients, I shall not forget the days of my partaking. I look forward to something new to look back on.

Good luck everyone, love ya.  "

What have **you** done this week."

68,"I found a race of pre-sentients with the Starborn trait. I strongly dislike this trait, as it hurts happiness so much. Is it worth it to uplift these guys?"
69,"Just going to jump right into this. Lately I just haven't been feeling playing bass or music at all. Which happens, I know, but let me preface this with some personal bass and music history. 

I started playing trumpet in 4th grade and played that for about 6 years in high school. Around 5th grade I briefly took keyboard lessons but had a terrible teacher so I stopped. 7th grade I decided I wanted to be in a band (and play keyboard) and talked all my friends into picking up instruments. One friend was already trying to talk his mom into playing drums, and another thought the guitar looked cool. By default I ended up with bass, and loved it instantly.
Moving on, I played with the same group of people for the next 6 years, convinced my High School band teacher that I should play the Tuba parts on the electric bass for 11th and 12th grade, and got better over time.
Then, in college, I joined my first *real* band, got real close with those guys (one was a long-time buddy), finally played some paid gigs, and then just... lost it. I lost interest, quit the band (many reasons for that, can go into detail), and haven't played much since.

So, my first problem is that I just don't feel it so much anymore. I still like music, but I don't know how my buddy can still play every second of every day. Needless to say, I've changed my hopes of becoming a rock star for just casual playing.

Second, I plateau'd in my playing **YEARS** ago. I've tried lessons, technique practice, switching playstyles. I just can't seem to get past where I've been longest time.

**tl;dr** I've been playing for 10 years, drive to play has diminished, and I have been plateau'd at my skill level for at least 5 years. How do I get past these?"

71,"I learned to ski when I was really young, and would usually go on ski trips a couple times a year with my family. Once I reached high school though, I switched to snowboarding, and never looked back... until now.

It's been 9 years since I've been on a pair of skis, and I was wondering if it would be worth it to bring my ski level back up to par. Is there anything I'm missing by only boarding? 

*Note: I'm not asking ""Which is better?"" I'm just asking if there's anything that skiing offers that snowboarding lacks.*"
72,"*sigh*

Excuse my grammar...i don't really care about revisions.

everyday, i do the same thing. I try to do something different, but i always end up back on the computer. Im a socially awkward nut who can't do anything. I feel as if my brothers are better than me. They are both outgoing, charasmatic, while I'm just a lonely introverted person. I can't even talk to my cousins because im awkward. I try and work on it but i can't. I don't think i'm mad because if my physical traits, but my mental traits. If i wasn't exposed to the computer, i would be normal like them. I just want to disappear without causing worry to my family. My circle of friends is getting smaller, and they're all moving on. I can't fit with anyone in my school.

If anyone is wondering, i'm interested in vlogging, rapping, beatboxing, piano, anime, airsoft, voice acting (getting into it), and videogames. 

I don't know what to do, but i know it's coming sooner or later. "

I am 17 years old, which means that next year I will be able to vote. I do not know much about politics or ideologies, so I am going to different political subreddits to ask what each one believes in. Luckily for you, r/neoliberal is my first stop! I want to become an informed voter, and to do that I need your help.

What do neoliberals believe in? Why is neoliberalism the best choice? What political parties do you support? Which politicians best represent your views? What are the biggest problems facing America today?  Would you describe neoliberalism as being left, right, or center? What do you want for the furure of America?

83,"The Unbidden spawned in my galaxy for the first time. My combined fleet power was around 35k so I figured I might be able to destroy the portal right where it spawned before the Unbidden had enough time to spawn to many fleets. Unfortunately as my fleet finished destroying the first unbidden fleet a second one had come through the portal. After the loses from fighting the first fleet I could no longer even destroy one fleet before the next one spawned and after a long slog all of my ships were destroyed. That was it the end of the galaxy. All of the AI empires were rated as pathetic compared to me fleet wise before this debacle. As my last ships exploded the pop up saying that the unbidden portal had been destroyed showed up.

Apparently a nearby xenophilic fallen empire had sent a fleet to the system and while the unbidden were occupied with my fleets they had destroyed the portal and saved the galaxy. This is a lot more than what I expected from the fallen empire.

108,"What do you normally wear with an infinity scarf?

I received [this](http://i.imgur.com/6YWZm.jpg) infinity scarf for Christmas. I have no idea what to wear with it. Today I wore a 3/4 sleeve kelly green shirt and some dark blue skinny jeans, and I think it looked *ok*, but I never left my house. So, I'm hoping you ladies can help me wear it out in public (and look good!). I think ideally I am looking for a casual weekend look.

I would say that I have a preppy/surferish style, if that makes sense. I have a lot of zip-up hoodies, prefer flats to heels, and am paler with dark brown hair.  I'm more a fan of solids than prints, and prefer neutral colors to loud (my closet has a lot of gray and navy, but I have some pieces that are a bit brighter). At the same time, I'm open to trying new things (which is why I'm here). I'm 5'6, 125 lb with a straight build. And I live in cold-weather territory.

111,"We know Everest is the highest mountain above sea-level now. But what was the greatest height above sea level ever attained by a mountain in the earth's past ?
We know that the height of a mountain is the equilibrium point between tectonic, or sometimes volcanic, forces pushing  it up, and gravitaional and weathering forces pulling it down.  
We also have a more or less accurate knowledge of all tectonic movements from pre-Cambrian on, and also of weather conditions over this period. So we should be able to come up with answer?

Since I started, I've really only had 3 cheat days, my mom's 80th birthday, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.  The first one seemed to help me break a 6 week plateau.  

With the exception of the plateau, I've lost pretty steadily, which at age 49, I really can't complain!

This sucks. But feels great!  This drive is amazing, I am taking action when it comes to women. I already scheduled two dates with two girls I am seeing, and completed a homework assignment in half the time to give me the time.  The best part about this massive horny feeling is controlling it.  I'm not gonna settle for a blow job tonight, that's masturbation in my book at the moment.  I am a man, melt in your hips not in your mouth.

142,"I was diagnosed with severe depression about a month ago by my general practitioner, and he said I should really begin exercising. I had started lifting weights a few weeks earlier, and he said I should do 30+ mins of low intensity cardio on lift days and 20+ mins of HIIT on offdays.  He also put me on a multivitamin, 2tsp fish oil and 300mg daily of 5-htp (natural serotonin booster).  After following this regimen almost to the T for the last month (I missed one cardio session because of a cold), as well as adding in 3 nights a week of MMA training, I've noticed that my depression has only gotten worse.  Every site I've visited on the web has treated exercise like some magical switch to cure depression.  Is the stuff I'm doing really out of whack and not helping my depression at all? Any advice would be appreciated.  "

144,"First off, NoFap is awesome. Love it. Has changed a lot about me and is revealing a lot of stuff. But I just want to make sure that people realize it will not fix everything for you. I don't think that is implied in the literature, but it can be suggested or seen as this be-all-end-all fix. While it has certainly helped me and a ton of people, I am finding that it has revealed a lot of underlying stuff that I was not dealing with. This is a great thing and I have NoFap and therapy to thank for that. 

Just don't go in expecting this to solve your depression, anxiety, ptsd, anger issues etc. It will definitely help, but there may just be a ton of underlying stuff you are not facing and NoFap will reveal it! NoFap may very well be just the start of the greater problems yet to be addressed. 

Stay strong!"
145,"In my younger days I never really cared what I looked like, so I kinda let myself go. I got really fat, and I bought the cheapest clothes from thrift stores possible. As of the summer of 2011, I weighed 240 pounds and looked like this:

I'm the one on the right, in case it needs saying.

Fast forward a couple months after these pics are taken, and I meet a girl online. We hit it off instantly and talk for a few months, but then feelings are admitted, and she insists on meeting. I refused over and over because of how I looked, naturally... it didn`t help that she was smokin' hot and clearly out of my league. 

Anywho, I tell her the whole story and how bad I look and that there's no chance anything can happen, but she says she`s willing to wait for me to be comfortable with myself before we meet. It took me about 5 months, but I lost 55 pounds, bringing me to a grand total of 185. These are pictures taken shortly after we got together:

First, a mug shot. The face was definitely the most drastic change for me.

Second, a full body shot:

We've been together ever since we met, and I love her more than the world :)

As for how I did it, it was diet. Only diet. I didn't really exercise (I know I should have). I just limited my diet to 1350 calories per day. I was pretty strict with it, and the pounds just steadily kept coming off. 

I'm not done yet, but I've lost a little steam... I'm at 185 of my 180 goal and I was considering working out and putting on a little muscle. With the new semester starting, I'll probably start going to the school gym. Wish me luck!

EDIT: This response is overwhelming! I'm at work right now but ill be home in two or so hours to respond to questions. Thank you all so much!


EDIT2: I'll say it again... overwhelming! I really didn't expect so much positive feedback. I can't thank you all enough. For someone who has felt fat and fugly his whole life, I really don't know how to react to this. I was very worried about posting it at all, thinking others have done so much more than I have and that I'd be called out on it. No regrets now :)

If you're trying to lose weight, don't you dare stop. Feeling like you successfully changed your life for the better is a feeling that's incredibly worth it. Keep at it and make it happen, and link me to **your** post when you're done!

FINAL EDIT: Well, it looks like this thread is finally coming to a close. I'm going to be starting back on the diet to lose my final few pounds and then I'm going to be hitting the gym a bit to see what I can accomplish. Maybe my next post will be on fittit. Wish me luck, and thanks for all the kind words... you've motivated me to reach my goals and go even further! :D"

171,"My main reason for posting this here as well on PokemonConspiracies is to try to get a general idea of what people on this subreddit want to see. If you don't want to see things like this, I won't be offended if you downvote and implore you to do so. The whole point is to see what this subreddit really is about. Nonetheless, hope you enjoy it.

If you subscribe to the T0mb0 chemical weapon origin story (http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/siv71/thoughts_on_the_kanto_war_a_means_for_victory/[1] ), then I believe this will make a lot of sense to you.

As Oddish was one of the first Pokemon to originate due to the contamination of the plants in Kanto, it was most likely one of the first Pokemon to ever be eaten. My theory is that a frog-like reptile, resembling the body of a Bulbasuar became the natural predator of the Oddish and more and more Oddish began to be eaten, as they would have provided more energy than the non-moving plants. Then, as the chemicals began to permeate the water supply and possibly even the air, they slowly caused a mutation in the digestion fluids of the frog-creature. The mixture of chemicals that came from the mutated Oddish and the mutated digestion fluids caused the Oddish to essentially seed the stomach of the frog, leeching onto spine and rib-cages for support, of the toad and grow out of its back, fighting with all it's might to find sunlight, in an extremely painful manner for the frog. As the Oddish's roots were infused into the digestive track and spine of the frog, the two began to share the products of their respective feeding styles: photosynthesis and common-digestion.

As the new species of frog, Bulbasuar, gathers more and more energy from the sun and it's own meals, which it now kills easily with the help of the Oddish's vines and its own physical features, the energy build up causes the Oddish plant in it's body to bud into a mutated version of Gloom (the mutation coming from the mutated digestion fluids). The budding in turn causes the frog's body to rapidly adapt to the new shape, creating Ivysaur. Similarly, when the plant reaches it's full blossom, what would be Vileplume in the original Oddish growth cycle, it again changes the shape of the frog, making it bigger, to adapt to the larger weight, but providing it with more energy.

As time went on, more and more of the infected frogs began to show up in the Kanto region, and when they began to mate, some were born with germinated Oddish plants already in their stomachs, creating the Pokemon breed Bulbasaur.

I am no biologist, so if there is anything fundamentally wrong with this let me know, but this is just the plausible scenario that came to me.

TL;DR A mutated frog ate an oddish and the oddish grew out of its back."

222,"I agree with John Coleman (global warming scam) that the earth is in a gradual warming cycle unrelated to CO2.

The politicization and hysterical fear surrounding the fact that earth seems to be in a gradual heating cycle has muted an important discussion -how awesome a warmer earth is going to be!  

People generally want to live in warmer climates and hate long cold winters (except winter sports lovers).  Animals have arduously adapted to cold winters but it’s a struggle and many don’t survive.  Trees and vegetation variations are dramatically more limited in cold climates.

Antarctic glacial melting will give humanity the gift of an entire inhabitable continent for exploration, farming, living!

So what are people complaining about?  Why do people insist that our current climate is any kind of ideal?

>""The symbol of all relationships among [rational] men, the moral symbol of respect for human beings, is the trader. We, who live by values, not by loot, are traders, both in matter and in spirit. A trader is a man who earns what he gets and does not give or take the undeserved. A trader does not ask to be paid for his failures, nor does he ask to be loved for his flaws. A trader does not squander his body as fodder or his soul as alms. Just as he does not give his work except in trade for material values, so he does not give the values of his spirit—his love, his friendship, his esteem—except in payment and in trade for human virtues, in payment for his own selfish pleasure, which he receives from men he can respect. The mystic parasites who have, throughout the ages, reviled the traders and held them in contempt, while honoring the beggars and the looters, have known the secret motive of their sneers: a trader is the entity they dread—a man of justice.""  - Atlas Shrugged"

231,"I've been struggling with this for a bit of time now. I read Into the Wild about 4 months ago, and I recently watched the movie (ehhhh). I don't know if I like Chris/Alex.

I think that it was incredibly irresponsible and selfish for him to take off without a trace leaving his sister and parents to writhe around for months. I think he was a bit unprepared for his trip into the wilderness, but I suppose the fact that he held out for months is testimony to his ability.

But what really irks me is his choice of ""wilderness"" and his apparent militant moral code. Unheeding. Unshifting. But he didn't even make it close to wilderness. That land was frequented during the hunting season by locals. Hell, the very fact that he found that bus made it civilization. I suppose that he was just looking to get away from human contact, which he did, but I don't know if that would even fit into his moral code or the romanticized wilderness of his idols.

As an individual, I guess he can do anything he wants and I shouldn't judge him for it. But as soon as he becomes the subject of a book, I think it's fair game to critique the character, if not just to figure out my own wanderlust.

244,"F/5'6""/20, 169- 127 [Comparison Picture NSFW](http://i.imgur.com/FCbSr.jpg)

I didn't start my New Years Resolution on the 1st, it took me until 11 Jan to realise that I was sick of myself, that I wanted to change. I was tired of being the chubby, unattractive girl who drank way too much. It would take me a few drinks by myself to be able to hang out with people in my halls because my self-confidence was so incredibly low, and I was afraid I'd come off as awkward and awkwardly quiet if I didn't pre-drink by myself for pre-drinks. Mostly, though, I was tired of being alone.

I decided that I was going to stop drinking so much, that I was going to lose weight, and I was going to get a boyfriend. Lofty goals, but I managed to do it!

I dropped from 169lbs to 127lbs. The weight loss generally came in waves, I would go months at a time (the end of spring and the end of summer) where I wouldn't lose anything at all. I kept at it, and I've been maintaining since Thanksgiving. My goal weight was 125, and maybe I'll lose those last 2lbs, but I'm happy with the way my body is now.

Food wise, I am a completely broke college student who can barely afford groceries. Therefore, I wasn't eating particularly good food. I was still eating a lot of pasta, but I made sure to measure it out and count calories. I ate carrots for snacks (low calorie and cheap). I ate about 1,200 calories a day. Maintaining now I eat about 1,500, but occasionally have 2,000 calorie days. I eat a *lot* of stir fry (delicious and low cal)

Exercise wise, I didn't really do much. In the beginning I went on long walks every day or every other day. I live in a city and don't have a car, so I end up walking 2-3 miles every day just going about my normal business. My uni doesn't have a gym, and I can barely afford groceries, so gym membership is out of the question. This New Year's Resolution is to keep the weight off and maybe start doing squats, planks, etc at home.

I don't drink nearly as much as I did before. I'll still have nights out, or a few glasses of wine with dinner, but I don't go overboard, and I don't drink by myself before hanging out with people (I also got better friends)

I've been with my bf for 10 months now. He had to move away from the city I live in during that time (shout out to /r/LongDistance), which has been incredibly difficult. We've had some communication issues, but we're hoping he'll be able to move back down soon. He's truly the most fantastic person I've ever met, and we're incredibly happy together.

TL;DR Tired of being perpetually drunk and lonely fattie, lost weight through counting calories, stopped drinking so much, acquired boyfriend"

248,"Hi,
I just finished the Culture series by Iain M. Banks. Incidentally, the last book I read was ""Inversions"", which was a nice last read to finish the series, as it leaves nice room for speculation. Banks has managed to weave in some nice cues.

However, I am also (like always) a bit sad to have finished the series, as this time my dive into it was especially deep. In contrast to other space operas, Banks focused on the human aspect and, in my opinion, goes well beyond the genre.

So, can you recommend another series or outstanding singular books for me? I have recently also enjoyed books by Kim Stanley Robinson, that, while they definitely have their lengths, still also manage to cover the human aspect quite well while maintaining a nice aspect of technical plausibility.

258,"I am speaking as a general merit student from the village. Lots of people are against caste reservations . But the fact is reservations are not meant to be fair or anything .

The SC/ST students may not be as good as us , but they bring more to the government as they work in rural areas. In my village all the clinics opened have been by SC/ST students .The General Merit doctors either they work in urban areas or they go off to some outside countries to work. Maybe the SC/ST students stay back in India cause they get more privileges in India , but the fact is they stay back in larger numbers than the Brahmins or other castes.

I made a thread about 6 months ago [here, on my old account](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/w8tsb/progress_pics_from_last_time_aroundfemale_21_yrs/) detailing how I got from 165 to 145 lbs - basically, I mostly cut out pop and fast food and started calorie counting.  Then I got stuck at 145 lbs for a while.  

I wanted to say, I managed to lose those ""last 15 pounds!""  My wonderful boyfriend helped me start going to the gym regularly - I was kind of embarrassed because I didn't know how to use any of the machines or do any exercises.  He helped me find a cardio/weightlifting program that's worked quite well for me, and we looked up how to do each exercise on YouTube before attempting it at the gym (to make sure I was doing it correctly.)  We also mostly cut out sugar and started putting more protein in our diets.

Over the summer, I managed to get down to 130 lbs.  My boyfriend had also wanted to gain weight - he put on 20 lbs and got more muscular!  So we were both victorious!

However, the holidays hit, and I was eating a lot of my sister's yummy holiday baking.  I'm back at around 132 now and have stayed there consistently.  I would love to lose another 5-10 lbs so I'm back on loseit to kick my butt in gear.  I don't have a very specific goal because sometimes it surprises me how much or how little a 5-lb loss will show on my frame, so I'm just going in with an open mind, but I'm hoping to land somewhere around 120 lbs.

284,"This is something we spoke about on [this week's podcast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKEYdpjT6NY).  The larger your population imbalance on a continent, the longer your spawn time.  The smaller your imbalance is, the shorter the spawn time.

Ideas for numbers (obviously subject to change):

* Between 30% and 36% continent population has no effect
* Each 1% above 36 adds 1 second to sunderer/tube spawn, 10 seconds to beacon spawn, and 20 seconds to vehicle spawns (to a maximum of 150% normal spawn time.  For example: 8 second spawn time at a facility would go no higher than 12 seconds)
* Each 2% below 30 reduces 1 second to sunderer/tube spawn, 10 seconds to beacon spawn, and 20 seconds to vehicle spawns (to a minimum of 60% normal spawn time)

This means when one side is very outnumbered, they at least have a spawn time advantage.  It also means that if you're on a continent where your side has 40% of the population, your waiting longer to spawn every time you die, and it's taking longer for you to get your vehicles.  This is a strong incentive to go fight on a map where you are not receiving these penalties.  

Such penalties/bonuses would need to be prominently displayed.  While waiting for spawn, it should be very clear that you are waiting extra time because your faction is currently overpopulated on a continent.

Something might be needed to deal with the fact that on some servers, one side just flat out has more people logged in at any given moment.  World population might need to be considered to adjust those numbers on the fly."

Feel free to ask questions, I would love to answer them.

P.S. Cheat days happen all the time, it's deciding to go back the next day that's the difference.

291,"Yesterday I found out one of my close friends passed away in a freak accident. I need to get my mind off of things and pass the time with some happy books... basically I'm looking for books that give a general feel of 'everything is all right', or can make me smile and laugh every couple pages. I'd prefer that they don't have any or at least too many 'down' moments; I already cry pretty easily at books and I don't want to open the floodgates.

Any ideas? I avoided a 'genre' flair because I didn't want to limit suggestions. :)"
292,"I'm posting this because [this story](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/18opl2/i_hate_mops/) reminded me of this personal frustration of mine. First time posting in here (and on reddit), won't be the last, love this group, etc etc.

I work in retail, and we mop on Sunday afternoons, twenty minutes before close. I hate that I have to mop then because I usually have to keep mopping until we have closed the store, because people walk through it and get it muddy, and then mop again after we close. Its pointless.

Now, I'll do one area at a time so whoever comes in at the last minute can go through another area to the cash register. Its an open space so it shouldn't be a problem... right?

Of course it's a problem. These are *customers* we are talking about.

We have several wet floor signs and I can usually position them so it more or less blocks off access to the area, you really have to push through them, and past me AND my giant bright yellow mop bucket to manage to ruin the floors.

People will come into the store with and I will politely ask them to walk in the other area as I am working on this one, and when they leave they will walk out through me and my mopping (still in the same area I was in before!) So frustrating.

I will literally be closing the doors, and having finally mopped the whole floor, a customer will burst through the door needing to buy ""just one little thing!"" With their trolley. They couldn't just leave it at the door (we are located in a shopping centre), they have to push it all around and then I have to redo everything. Ugh, so annoying!

tl;dr: Customers are stupid, mopping is stupid, mopping for twenty five minutes is stupid. The end."

I think there are few words that feel as ugly and awkward as the word obese. Its the kind of word that always follows a sympathetic pause in the presence of the paunchy. It is so round and clinical and weighted down with taciturn lowness that it clings to a person in a way that squeezes and cripples him with what is simultaneously the most formidable and and the most elementary malady for a person to beat. January 5, marked one year since I resolved to change myself.This essay will probably be the most gushing and candid thing I’ve ever written, parts of this may seem attention seeking or boastful but I promise that this comes from the deepest, most sincere, and thought-worn parts of my heart. Its something I’ve had kicking around in my head for the better part of 15 years; this is the eulogy for my obesity.


Size has always dominated me, I began to chub around the fourth grade. I wouldn’t say that I was by any means a too-sad kid but I do think that feeling sad was a trigger for me. As a kid I had a difficult time finding a place where I felt like I was supposed to be. Whenever I would venture a try at something new, I would inevitably leave inadequate. I would feel bitter about being rejected by girls or I would feel sad about not being able to keep up with boys. In response I withdrew and went to food. As I grew up, I never felt right and I never I had anything that was mine with which to excel…I would fantasize about accomplishment and taking ownership of the kind of charisma and strength that would enamour me to those girls and make myself a hero in the minds of those guys, but I had lost so much ground over time that the idea of changing anything was daunting. It felt like my life was looming over me and I used food and humor as a means to swat it.


Gaining weight was mostly gradual with a few sharp spikes. It went on slowly until one day I realized that I was a fat kid and at once the idea got stuck in my head. I remember this feeling of compliance like:""well, this is me now."" As I grew older and boundaries widened, I became heavier. I would ride my bike to the Meijer on Clyde Park when it had a McDonalds in it and I would eat a Double Quarter meal Super-Sized and a twenty-piece chicken nuggets, turn around and ride home. This secret meal would lay on top of everything else I eaten during the day and I would enjoy it with stealth in my mind. It didn’t help that I was also slow to develop socially; I didn't have friends yet and food became music for me. It entertained and occupied me. I would go to movies by myself (which I loved doing) I would devour my lonely popcorn and inhale my propitious Pepsi. With every little bit of freedom I enjoyed, my weight gain would apex and level off. When I got my first job (at a pizza joint) I had tons of free food and money to spend on whatever I liked, when I got my license I could travel farther for different brands and combinations of fast food. Every bit of independance further cemented my habits.


Eventually I did develop a bit of a social lean but I still had a hard time accepting myself to my peers, I always felt like my stature stood between us. For example, one year we went to Michigan Adventure, I hadn’t thought much about the seat in a roller coaster and and never had a problem with a lap bar, but then I got in line for The Corkscrew. We waited eagerly and when the time came I walked up to the cart and looked inside and I thought ""shit."" I sat down next to a friend and it was tight but we were both able to sit. I reach up to pull down the shoulder harness and it wouldn’t click. My chest is too far from my back to get the harness to lock. I want to get out but instead an employee comes to me and tries to help by pressing it into me while I 'suck it in' No dice. I stood up and walked away with all the eyes on my back. I held the ride up and I was that fat kid that didn’t fit so I watched my friends ride the coaster from the sidewalk. It was the first time my size made me feel t isolated in front of someone. My attitude was to quietly tack roller coasters on to a list of things I couldn’t do. Eventually I out grew movie theater seats, airplane seats, and ‘Big & Tall’ sections in the mall and I passively waved goodbye to all of them.


And time just passed by - I built powerful, lasting, and comfortable relationships. I worked and had fun but never really achieved anything. I had quiet goals but all of the things I wanted for myself came to be plain conversational fodder, things you get drunk and dream about out loud. Everything I wanted was so public and everything I was was so private. I wanted to act and I wanted to be a comedian. I did open mics and it left me disgusted and exposed, it was a sort of exhilarating misery that kept you facing the goals you pushed away. I gradually lost momentum and just sort of stalled. Life for a few years was like a room dimly lit by the flickering light of a TV. It was quiet, and private, and comfortable. I remained stealthily obsessed with food. It occupied my mind. The flavors and textures and that feeling of occupation in your core gave me a sense of contentment that was so durable that it became ever-present in my life.


I haven’t always lacked a sense of the need for change. Periodically, I would have manic bouts of conviction and backbone. I would face the world and strive to be social, and better, and healthy. I would purse comedy again, I joined gyms, I sought and gained relationships...complacency though eventually had me back in my room eroding from a habit bordering agoraphobia. Eventually I realized that I wasn’t the possessor friends I once was and I became aware of the cheerlessness I felt for myself and that revealed to me the delicacy of the relationships I had. I was pushing people away from me so that I could revel in my faults. I began to see the folly and futility of so many of the years behind me. I became morbidly mindful of my mortality; I would imagine a roommate finding me dead and how they would react. How my family would react. In that, I realized that I’d lived so absent mindedly for so long that I had become OK with being dead when I was 40 and had subconsciously planned to be alone and idle for whatever time I had left. I’d let indulgence and apathy become intuitive.


A dramatic shift in my mindset came to pass around summer 2011. It was also around this time that I, as none of my friends or family knew, auditioned for a weight loss reality show. On the show, overweight men and women are taken away to a fitness sanctuary where they are taught healthy habits and exercise and exercise and exercise ... it was much like a real-life adult version of the movie Heavyweights. While gone, participants don’t communicate with family or friends and then, after an agonizing and heart lifting episode is complete, they are revealed to friends and family in a new body and attitude. I wanted to be a part of that show and thought I had it. I was interviewed and inline to be a part of the show when, abruptly, the series was put on hold and the new season never materialized.

I was devastated. I had poured my future into this idea that I could be taken away and fixed. That I was going to leave and come back as a new person for everyone to hold up cheer for. I had built up tremendous optimism and lost it all just as quickly. I went right back onto the destructive beat I had just left. Looking back, not making it on that show broke something for me and pushed me to get bad enough that I could get better.


Fortunately it only took about six months, I grieved the loss of my spotlight and my champion transformative moment and during that time reflected soulfully about who I am to the people in my life, who I am to myself, and most importantly recognized that I have it in myself to become the kind of person I want to be: I want to constantly be aware of my potential. I want to be a man that knows and practices right from wrong. I want to modestly inspire goodness, optimism, and effort in people; I want my integrity and my character to be something worth holding up. I want to be external and in the lives of people and I want people to feel that having me in their lives is a thing of value. In order to realize these things I had to accept accountability for what had misrepresented my capability and demeaned my resolve for so long. It wasn’t my weight, it was my attitude about life and an enduring lack of enthusiasm for the future.


I took responsibility for my well being one year ago, I weighed 420 pounds, I wore a XXXXXL dress shirt and 48 jeans. My life and the way I lived it literally changed overnight and hasn’t stumbled. I began by eating a calorie restricted diet and eventually shifted to focus on lower carbohydrates. For exercise I started by walking three miles a day. I would take the bus to school, get off walk a ways and get back on further down the route. Once spring rolled around I began to bike. Those rides progressed from two, to six, to ten mile rides, mostly to and from school. Soon the distance between school and home wasn’t clear or long enough so riding became a purposeful thing rather than utility. I rode and rode. By the end of the summer I had joined the half century club having ridden over fifty miles in one ride. In August I began running using the Couch to 5k program and ran my first full 5k on November 17 and putted along to finish my first 10k on December 15. As of today I have lost 178 pounds, wear a large and 34 jeans. I am stronger and faster than I’ve ever felt myself be. I feel appreciation and optimism in everything that I do and I sense that this is the way life should feel. I’ve still got a lot of work to do but at this point the habits have rooted and the education that I’ve gained over the last year will nurture them. I cannot see my life going backwards, this is who I was always supposed to be.


I’ve spent most of my life planning and daydreaming without action and now everything seems so attainable.This is why I write today, I’m ready to say goodbye to that old life now and to focus on maintaining goal oriented momentum and pushing harder so that the strength in my musings becomes the strength in my character. I can do better, I can do better. I can be the Greatest Man in the World.


Thank you to Mom, my Dad, Jerry, My brothers Eric and Adam, Jessica, Marshall, Corey, Colby; you guys specifically have given me clarity and always been frank with be about delicate things. And to Britt, Allen, Jen, Margie, and Alex, you guys give me the happiness I need to suck it up and do it. This might all seem overly sentimental but I only plan on doing this once and you’ve changed my life in ways that can’t really make sense to you.


Part of the audition process for the reality show I mentioned was to create a series of videos focusing on different aspects of my life. I edited one of them and am keeping a few private, but as for the rest, I don’t see a reason to keep it closeted anymore, I feel like that person is gone now. I uploaded these in May 2011, until now it has been accessible only to the producers of the show. For those interested, I have the links listed below. I think they are a thought-provoking relic.

358,"My wife and I have been taking individual swing dancing lessons for about a year now. I started out pretty phobic - wouldn't let them uncover the mirrors and often came out of the lesson feeling shell shocked (both wife and instructor are awesome and understanding). It's gotten much better - we've gone out dancing a couple of times and sometimes I even have fun! That said, I've had this sense of ""now what?"" the past several lessons. Like...just keep learning new steps and go out occasionally?

I'm not even quite sure what I'm asking here or what I need. I want to continue dancing and get better at it, but it feels like I'm losing momentum and I'm not sure what my/our goal is.

Anyone have any thoughts? Or maybe ask me some questions to clarify? Or is this just too vague?"

365,"Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

Hey loseit! So I've been dieting and exercising for 3 full weeks now and just had a check up appointment with my nutritionist. I don't own a scale and usually measure myself anyways (down ~inch) but at my appointment I weighed in at 190lbs, I started at an even 200lbs two weeks ago! 

I know its a fast weight loss in 2 weeks but I'm sure it's due to cutting out all soda, most sweets and working out (gym & C25K) and I will slow down a bit. 

It's not very noticeable yet (only to me), but [here's](http://imgur.com/hv9sexk) what I've got so far. I'm thrilled! "

I think there are few words that feel as ugly and awkward as the word obese. Its the kind of word that always follows a sympathetic pause in the presence of the paunchy. It is so round and clinical and weighted down with taciturn lowness that it clings to a person in a way that squeezes and cripples him with what is simultaneously the most formidable and and the most elementary malady for a person to beat. January 5, marked one year since I resolved to change myself.This essay will probably be the most gushing and candid thing I’ve ever written, parts of this may seem attention seeking or boastful but I promise that this comes from the deepest, most sincere, and thought-worn parts of my heart. Its something I’ve had kicking around in my head for the better part of 15 years; this is the eulogy for my obesity.


Size has always dominated me, I began to chub around the fourth grade. I wouldn’t say that I was by any means a too-sad kid but I do think that feeling sad was a trigger for me. As a kid I had a difficult time finding a place where I felt like I was supposed to be. Whenever I would venture a try at something new, I would inevitably leave inadequate. I would feel bitter about being rejected by girls or I would feel sad about not being able to keep up with boys. In response I withdrew and went to food. As I grew up, I never felt right and I never I had anything that was mine with which to excel…I would fantasize about accomplishment and taking ownership of the kind of charisma and strength that would enamour me to those girls and make myself a hero in the minds of those guys, but I had lost so much ground over time that the idea of changing anything was daunting. It felt like my life was looming over me and I used food and humor as a means to swat it.


Gaining weight was mostly gradual with a few sharp spikes. It went on slowly until one day I realized that I was a fat kid and at once the idea got stuck in my head. I remember this feeling of compliance like:""well, this is me now."" As I grew older and boundaries widened, I became heavier. I would ride my bike to the Meijer on Clyde Park when it had a McDonalds in it and I would eat a Double Quarter meal Super-Sized and a twenty-piece chicken nuggets, turn around and ride home. This secret meal would lay on top of everything else I eaten during the day and I would enjoy it with stealth in my mind. It didn’t help that I was also slow to develop socially; I didn't have friends yet and food became music for me. It entertained and occupied me. I would go to movies by myself (which I loved doing) I would devour my lonely popcorn and inhale my propitious Pepsi. With every little bit of freedom I enjoyed, my weight gain would apex and level off. When I got my first job (at a pizza joint) I had tons of free food and money to spend on whatever I liked, when I got my license I could travel farther for different brands and combinations of fast food. Every bit of independance further cemented my habits.


Eventually I did develop a bit of a social lean but I still had a hard time accepting myself to my peers, I always felt like my stature stood between us. For example, one year we went to Michigan Adventure, I hadn’t thought much about the seat in a roller coaster and and never had a problem with a lap bar, but then I got in line for The Corkscrew. We waited eagerly and when the time came I walked up to the cart and looked inside and I thought ""shit."" I sat down next to a friend and it was tight but we were both able to sit. I reach up to pull down the shoulder harness and it wouldn’t click. My chest is too far from my back to get the harness to lock. I want to get out but instead an employee comes to me and tries to help by pressing it into me while I 'suck it in' No dice. I stood up and walked away with all the eyes on my back. I held the ride up and I was that fat kid that didn’t fit so I watched my friends ride the coaster from the sidewalk. It was the first time my size made me feel t isolated in front of someone. My attitude was to quietly tack roller coasters on to a list of things I couldn’t do. Eventually I out grew movie theater seats, airplane seats, and ‘Big & Tall’ sections in the mall and I passively waved goodbye to all of them.


And time just passed by - I built powerful, lasting, and comfortable relationships. I worked and had fun but never really achieved anything. I had quiet goals but all of the things I wanted for myself came to be plain conversational fodder, things you get drunk and dream about out loud. Everything I wanted was so public and everything I was was so private. I wanted to act and I wanted to be a comedian. I did open mics and it left me disgusted and exposed, it was a sort of exhilarating misery that kept you facing the goals you pushed away. I gradually lost momentum and just sort of stalled. Life for a few years was like a room dimly lit by the flickering light of a TV. It was quiet, and private, and comfortable. I remained stealthily obsessed with food. It occupied my mind. The flavors and textures and that feeling of occupation in your core gave me a sense of contentment that was so durable that it became ever-present in my life.


I haven’t always lacked a sense of the need for change. Periodically, I would have manic bouts of conviction and backbone. I would face the world and strive to be social, and better, and healthy. I would purse comedy again, I joined gyms, I sought and gained relationships...complacency though eventually had me back in my room eroding from a habit bordering agoraphobia. Eventually I realized that I wasn’t the possessor friends I once was and I became aware of the cheerlessness I felt for myself and that revealed to me the delicacy of the relationships I had. I was pushing people away from me so that I could revel in my faults. I began to see the folly and futility of so many of the years behind me. I became morbidly mindful of my mortality; I would imagine a roommate finding me dead and how they would react. How my family would react. In that, I realized that I’d lived so absent mindedly for so long that I had become OK with being dead when I was 40 and had subconsciously planned to be alone and idle for whatever time I had left. I’d let indulgence and apathy become intuitive.


A dramatic shift in my mindset came to pass around summer 2011. It was also around this time that I, as none of my friends or family knew, auditioned for a weight loss reality show. On the show, overweight men and women are taken away to a fitness sanctuary where they are taught healthy habits and exercise and exercise and exercise ... it was much like a real-life adult version of the movie Heavyweights. While gone, participants don’t communicate with family or friends and then, after an agonizing and heart lifting episode is complete, they are revealed to friends and family in a new body and attitude. I wanted to be a part of that show and thought I had it. I was interviewed and inline to be a part of the show when, abruptly, the series was put on hold and the new season never materialized.

I was devastated. I had poured my future into this idea that I could be taken away and fixed. That I was going to leave and come back as a new person for everyone to hold up cheer for. I had built up tremendous optimism and lost it all just as quickly. I went right back onto the destructive beat I had just left. Looking back, not making it on that show broke something for me and pushed me to get bad enough that I could get better.


Fortunately it only took about six months, I grieved the loss of my spotlight and my champion transformative moment and during that time reflected soulfully about who I am to the people in my life, who I am to myself, and most importantly recognized that I have it in myself to become the kind of person I want to be: I want to constantly be aware of my potential. I want to be a man that knows and practices right from wrong. I want to modestly inspire goodness, optimism, and effort in people; I want my integrity and my character to be something worth holding up. I want to be external and in the lives of people and I want people to feel that having me in their lives is a thing of value. In order to realize these things I had to accept accountability for what had misrepresented my capability and demeaned my resolve for so long. It wasn’t my weight, it was my attitude about life and an enduring lack of enthusiasm for the future.


I took responsibility for my well being one year ago, I weighed 420 pounds, I wore a XXXXXL dress shirt and 48 jeans. My life and the way I lived it literally changed overnight and hasn’t stumbled. I began by eating a calorie restricted diet and eventually shifted to focus on lower carbohydrates. For exercise I started by walking three miles a day. I would take the bus to school, get off walk a ways and get back on further down the route. Once spring rolled around I began to bike. Those rides progressed from two, to six, to ten mile rides, mostly to and from school. Soon the distance between school and home wasn’t clear or long enough so riding became a purposeful thing rather than utility. I rode and rode. By the end of the summer I had joined the half century club having ridden over fifty miles in one ride. In August I began running using the Couch to 5k program and ran my first full 5k on November 17 and putted along to finish my first 10k on December 15. As of today I have lost 178 pounds, wear a large and 34 jeans. I am stronger and faster than I’ve ever felt myself be. I feel appreciation and optimism in everything that I do and I sense that this is the way life should feel. I’ve still got a lot of work to do but at this point the habits have rooted and the education that I’ve gained over the last year will nurture them. I cannot see my life going backwards, this is who I was always supposed to be.


I’ve spent most of my life planning and daydreaming without action and now everything seems so attainable.This is why I write today, I’m ready to say goodbye to that old life now and to focus on maintaining goal oriented momentum and pushing harder so that the strength in my musings becomes the strength in my character. I can do better, I can do better. I can be the Greatest Man in the World.


Thank you to Mom, my Dad, Jerry, My brothers Eric and Adam, Jessica, Marshall, Corey, Colby; you guys specifically have given me clarity and always been frank with be about delicate things. And to Britt, Allen, Jen, Margie, and Alex, you guys give me the happiness I need to suck it up and do it. This might all seem overly sentimental but I only plan on doing this once and you’ve changed my life in ways that can’t really make sense to you.


Part of the audition process for the reality show I mentioned was to create a series of videos focusing on different aspects of my life. I edited one of them and am keeping a few private, but as for the rest, I don’t see a reason to keep it closeted anymore, I feel like that person is gone now. I uploaded these in May 2011, until now it has been accessible only to the producers of the show. For those interested, I have the links listed below. I think they are a thought-provoking relic.

The yellow fever towards women is a problem as well but that is more documented (imo) than the problems of Asian males. So, as an Asian girl, what can we do to help our Asian male counterparts? And as a child, what can I do to prevent Asians from being discriminated against? Do you think the tides are changing for us? Are there any other folks my age here who have similar concerns?

The blue skinned space babe trope has always been one of my fave sci fi tropes \(pretty girls in outer space with blue or purple skin, what more could you want?\)  It also helps that the asari are pretty much a combination of my two favourite Zelda races: the Zora and the Gerudo.  I also find their head crests very stylish and fun to draw.  And finally visually, I just think of them as being ""Princess Ruto but in space!""

I am a big guy...BMI over 30 and I have really been thinking about running to lose weight... But I am suffer from large moobs..

I really wanted your honest thoughts on what you dedicated fellows see when you see a fat man running ....struggling...

Deep down - do you laugh at the person? Do you snicker? What is it that goes through your heads when you see such a situation?

Dont worry - if you do feel like the guy is a loser or any such thing - just be honest! It would help me - and certainly other big people know how to react (or how to strengthen the mind) before running

Thanks guys for your opinions (and honesty!)

Guys! Thank you! I mean there is absolutely no way I could have expected such a warm response and I hope that this post will help all those people peeking into this sub-reddit for the first time.

Thank you very much runners! You cannot believe how much anxiety exists within my mind (and I am sure in a number of 'big' people's minds - this goes a very long way in reducing that!

I want to tell each and every single one of you who replied to this post (and I appreciate the honesty most of all!) - Thank You! From a fellow human being - this really warms my heart!

Thanks again guys! I will definitely put on my trainers this coming Saturday and belt out a couple of kilometres.

EDIT: I guess my post needs more detail so here's the comment:

It's been a wild ride so far! I was a [fat kid](http://i.imgur.com/nJfeP.jpg) (that's me on the right), then I developed anorexia at age 14 which nearly killed me (the only pictures I have left of this time are NSFW, sorry). Age 17 I went into recovery, gained weight and was happy and healthy by age 18. Then a myriad of social, academic, and medical issues caused me to start seeking solace in too much alcohol and even more food. I gained a shit ton of weight, became severely depressed, lost all interest in everything and felt awful all the time.

Then one day something clicked and it seems silly to say but I owe it all to [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NFWgG4_6NI). I was just mesmerized by the way that girl moves and how lithe her body is. I watched 20 seconds of that video, looked down at my own body and said ""To hell with this!"" and haven't looked back. I don't have a rigid workout schedule or a diet plan, I just go with what feels right. Nothing is totally off-limits. If I want a glass of wine or a pack of Skittles, I'm gonna have it! As for exercise, I do Zumba and yoga, I love hula-hooping and I recently found a belly-dancing sarong I bought in Taiwan a few years back so I'd love to get into that! Also, I used to throw myself into either starving myself or gorging myself to deal with stress: now I throw myself into working out!

I started looking at /r/loseit back in August for inspiration. I remember looking at everyone's progress pictures and wishing I could just fast-forward through the hard part and be looking at my own progress pictures. Well, the hard part is half the fun, isn't it? If we were able to skip the shitty parts, none of us would feel half as proud of ourselves as we are. And believe me, I am one *proud* girl :)"

Some background - 

I started right when I got out of college.    I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering and got the job because the CEO and I went to the same college AND because I busted my butt during a 1 month internship.

We build whatever places/museums asked us to build.  All the wiring/programming is custom and in-house.  Everything we build is done in-house.  Most/all of the design is done in house.  We've built things for the Boston Museum of Science, the Spy Museum in Washington DC, the Smithsonian, Blue Man Group, and a whole host of other clients.

I've posted several of my projects to Reddit before and people seemed to enjoy them.  I've also received several requests for an IAMA and I'll be sitting at an airport for the next 3.5 hours so here we go.  I'll also probably spring for the in-flight wifi so have at!

Also, if you've seen [MathAlive!](http://www.mathalive.com), a travelling math exhibit, we built that too.  That was a big one.

A project is started that aims to test and modify intelligence in chimpanzees, dogs, rats, cephalopods and dolphins.

The animals, (housed in very generously-sized and funded zoo facilities) will be bred and possibly genetically and technologically modified in order to maximize their reasoning and comunication abilities.

The long-term goal of the project would be to communicate with these animals at the levels of human adults and teach them complex concepts. Decisions could then be made on encouraging this new intelligence to multiply.

Aside from questions around the exact definition of intelligence and moral objections to keeping any animals in a zoo, what further moral issues are raised if this was attempted?"
423,"I find that when I'm super depressed, songs dealing with depression and suicide are comforting and I keep going back to them again and again. 

Then when I get stable if these same songs pop up they make me cry. I think it might be because I'm remembering how bad I felt. Anyway, I feel good overall but started crying at work and it was a little embarrassing (I work in an open bullpen style office so it's tough to hide). This isn't the first time either. Maybe I need to just take those songs off my phone completely :/

I dunno, just curious if this happens to anyone else."

425,"So. It's been a while since I started on this thing in here.

I feel I've come a long way in the past 8 months. I was your average bear kissless 23 year old virgin. 2 weeks ago I made out with 3 different girls in one night, and I didn't even try really. I'm not saying this is a marker of success or something that happens regularly, but I think it's an interesting result. Probably won't do that again. It was fun, but it ruined for what could have been a lot more productive friend making with lots of other people. Problem now is new people I meet think that's what I'm like. Also, I am not taking this any amount of seriously, I'm just having fun learning, and seeing what I can do. I am not expecting anything, and not trying for anything.

I am still just as nerdy as I've always been I feel like, and I still have streaks of awkwardness, but that is also getting better. I'm also getting better at gauging and reading into the situation if there is anything there, and it doesn't bother me if something doesn't work out the way I hoped. I recently met this really cool girl, one of the very few I have ever felt a serious interest in. I tried to keep in contact with her somehow, then made a lot of rookie mistakes, but turns out she's mainly into the big, tall bro-y type party guys, so it was not something for me anyway. The point is, this might have bothered me before, but as of the current situation, I don't really care. I'm short, pretty nerdy, fit, and I have my audience, which I accept. I would still very much have liked keeping her as a friend, which might still be salvagable, but I'm not sure as I feel like I fucked up pretty badly.

I'm not sure why I'm posting this, I just thought I'd post some thoughts. I have had nowhere near the success and change of mr Shakedown, but I'm happy to see things improve and change for something better.

To everyone else, work on it and it will come eventually."

I remember my earliest days of struggling and first going on Google to see if there was anything to help, and then Amazon to see if there were resources like workbooks or just books. Spoiler alert, [none of these results](http://imgur.com/a/SYzQ3) are particularly helpful. Phillip Guo's article explains and in a way justifies the way Asian parents discipline us, and Amazon's top result is really just a trigger.

I know (thanks to namer98) that the Jews have lots of commentaries, and more are published even now, and namer98 often makes his points using those commentaries. I don't know how many causal Jews are aware of these, though. 

Hindus also have a huge number of commentaries from various points of view, but most people (causal Hindus) aren't aware of them.

So which is the case with Christianity? Lack of commentaries or lack of awareness of commentaries or something else?

477,"So I thought we should have a thread to discuss titles and spend more time avoiding writing.

My title is My Worst Friends Wedding

I chose this because It is largely about a ""worst friend"", being the most unlikeable and hard to get along person with someone knows, that they still might feel for some reason be it obligation or pity to call or act as a friend. The event that the protagonists (or antagonists?) are attending is the stag night and wedding. Also I liked the idea of playing off the title of ""My Best Friends Wedding"". I am worried people will see more of a connection than that, I haven't even seen the film but I am pretty sure they are nothing alike. Also I hope the spitefulness of the title suggests that it isn't a Romcom.

**Gender**: Female.  Obviously.

**Height**: 5'11""

**Age**: 24

--------------------------

I think I've hit a bit of a plateau, so I'm hoping that looking at my progress so far will keep me motivated.  Truth be told, although the scale, measuring tape, and pictures show a difference... I don't feel different *at all*.  Perhaps I will once I get below 200 pounds.

I'm not entirely certain what it is that finally galvinized me to change.  I've always been ""big,"" both horizontally and vertically.  I'm the black sheep of my extended family, in that regard (well, horizontally.  A lot of my relatives are tall).  But I have never identified myself by my body; always with my brain, actions, and bank account.  So while I haven't been *happy* with my body, it hasn't particularly been a source of anguish.  I have successfully lost weight in the past; I got down to a healthy BMI for a while in high school, but the weight crept back on through the years.

I've heard that lifestyle changes are easier to make when they happen in conjunction with other large life changes.  So when I moved and switched jobs, it seemed like the logical turning point for my corporeal self.  Add on my frustration with clothes shopping (so difficult when you are big and tall and small boobed), and a comment from my boyfriend (that he loved me, but if I continued to be so overweight he wasn't sure how physically attracted he would be to me years from now), and possibly other forgotten factors, and the result is where I am now.

Here's the lifestyle changes I've made:

**August, 2012**

Got a job in the city, rather than the suburbs.  Started walking ~1.5 miles a day for public transportation.  Started eating ungodly amounts of unhealthy snacks, provided free at work.

**September**

Got a bike mid-September.  Immediately became a full-time bike commuter.  10 miles round trip, flat ground.

**October**

Stopped eating the free unhealthy snacks at work, cold turkey.  That was 400+ calories a day.  Started being more organized about bringing healthier lunches.

**November**

Woke up at 5:30am three days a week for a 5 week kettlebell class that I got off of groupon.  Loved it, but the full fee is out of my price range, and I was only able to motivate myself to wake up so early because I knew it was temporary.

**December**

Joined a gym near work.  Did unorganized, self directed exercise.  Also took a couple of ""cardio sculpt"" classes.  Went on vacation.

**January**

Started the program laid out in ""New Rules of Lifting for Women"".  

-----------------------

My current exercise schedule (beyond the 55+ miles a week I get from riding my bike *everywhere*) is:

**Monday**: Lift.

**Tuesday**: Cardio kickboxing.

**Wednesday**: Rest.

**Thursday**: Lift during lunch.  Yoga after work.

**Friday**: Rest.

**Saturday**: Lift.

**Sunday**: Rest.

--------------------------------

Like I said, I feel like I've hit a bit of a plateau; my weight has hovered in the 220's since Christmas.  Part of it is that I feel out of shape because I've been biking slowly recently.  I'm hoping it is the ""sub zero after windchill"" weather that is responsible.

My workout schedule is pretty intense right now, and I'm a bit afraid of burn out.  But it hasn't happened yet.  Other things are slipping a bit; my room is much more of a disaster than usual, and there's a Microsoft certification that I *really* need to get around to studying for (I want to get a bonus at work), but I'm often tired in the evening and that the last thing on my mind is cracking open a text book.

But anyway.  Figured I'd share."

493,"Hey Leaves, 

When I smoked, I used to love business trips.  The thrill of finding ways to get weed to my destination in ways MacGyver would be proud of and the freedom of being away from those that strongly disapproved of my habit made the hassle of business travel exciting. 

Since I quit 222 days ago (but who's counting?), I have not had any reasons to travel for work until last week.  And the destination? Colorado, home of newly legalized weed.   

Well, I made it through unscathed.  I thought about it. And from what a coworker in that area hinted at, I could have had access.  So tempting. 

But knowing that I would be pissed at myself for giving in, and knowing I would disappoint the friends I have made in this group, I stuck to the straight and narrow.   It was so worth it.  And I was highly productive and got done more than I had planned while I was there. 

So the moral of the story is getting high will never feel as good as the self respect you gain for staying on course. 

Peace. "

Edit: WOW!, thanks for all of the responses. 

I can agree with you guys on Brin not being the best writer for this series. But I really loved the whole idea of uplifting and also the idea of ancient races and finding clues about these races. I read the books long ago and at the time I enjoyed them.

I do think that the uplift world would/could make for a good TV series, like GOT."

511,"All-  From the survey results, it was pretty much split down the middle about whether or not we should be posting images of ourselves in practice to the sub.  Lots of the nay's cited not wanting to see ego, or improper execution, or being humbled.  Lots of the yay's cited inspiration, fun to share etc.  That being said, a vast majority of the sub's all time top posts are of people's practice.  However, I do understand users NOT wanting to see those things on this sub as that is not what they believe yoga should be. 

So I propose the we should institute a required tag on images (videos?) of ourselves in asana. Think something similar to [NSFW] or [Meta].  My thought is [COMP] standing for Check out My Practice. That way, users who do not want those on their /r/yoga can filter them out using [Reddit Enhancement Suite] (http://redditenhancementsuite.com/).

So for example some of the current posts on our sub would be:

[COMP] Making progress towards scorpion!

[COMP] Got into dragonfly. :]

517,"In most of the science fiction media that I've consumed, most aliens are in a humanoid shape. They communicate in a similar way to humans. Sometimes they don't even differ much in appearance. I find this unrealistic because next to all aliens, due to entirely different ecosystems and environments, evolutionary history, and civilisation history, would in most likelihood be extremely if not totally different from us. 

What i'm looking for is science fiction with very alien aliens. Aliens that aren't like humans at all, or at least differ in some significant way. The kind of aliens i have in mind don't have: 

. Humanoid shapes

. The same way of communicating 

. The same beliefs, ideologies, or political structures  

. The same morality or ethics 

. The same way of physically moving 

. The same way of handling objects and tools

. The same senses of perception of the world 

. The same physiology  

I want to speculate and learn about just how much alien species could differ in every way imaginable.

You are always the best people to ask for good scifi books.

I am looking for ones about people helping a primitive civilisation get more advanced. I'm mostly thinking about main characters being humans from an advanced world/time and finding a primitive alien civilisation. Maybe they crash and need the aliens to reach space age so they can leave (the main characters would be immortal) but any variation of that main theme would be great already."

Donated Blood today,
wanted to share how it went.

I donated at 
  
Bloodbank @ Health Sciences Authority (HSA)

  Its close to Outram Park MRT Station, walking distance.

**[List of places to donate](http://www.hsa.gov.sg/publish/hsaportal/en/health_services/blood_donation/wheretodonate.html?direct=1)**

You can choose to donate 

* whole blood (regular donation) **OR**
* platelets and plasma ([apheresis](http://www.hsa.gov.sg/publish/hsaportal/en/health_services/blood_donation/what_to_donate/apheresis.html))

Apheresis is recommended for non-first timers in my opinion.

Apheresis requires large veins that will not collapse for the hour long procedure.

I tried once but it collapsed halfway. They told me to try again in 2 years.

**Highly recommended to make an appointment before going down**

-Its pretty fast, can just make a phone call or use your SingPass

-You get placed in a priority line, which speed things up a bit depending on the crowd that day.

Once inside, this is the rough flow of things.

1. Fill up Questionnaire, hand it in.

2. Wait to be called for the doctor to take your blood pressure, temperature etc.

3. Next station, they prick a finger to test your haemoglobin levels to see whether you meet the minimum. 

4. Enter the area with the chairs, and the staff will get you prepared for the procedure, pretty friendly, though it seems that they use similar lines to make donors feel at ease, better than nothing though.

5. Vein check, inject anaesthesia, etc, the actual process itself.

6. Wait for blood to be drawn out, 450 mls. My bag took 3:30 for it to be filled.

The actual process itself is very much shorter than the form-filling and waiting. Pretty fast, total time is close to half hour.

During the process itself the staff will hand you a food voucher, 
and some iron tablets to replenish your iron supply.

**If you visit in between 11.30 and 1.30pm**

It is considered lunchtime and a full meal will be redeemed using the voucher.
[**Menu for that day**](http://imgur.com/PQBHX)

Other times would just be a snack.

I also received a pretty thick notebook. Hardcover and bound pretty nicely. Came in a plastic cover shaped like a blood bag and a sticker/decal that mimicked a blood bag label.

On top of that there was also an extra gift because of donating during my birthday month. It was an handheld electric fan with a pretty cute and cool function, where it flashed ""Happy Birthday"". Good for a chuckle.

redditors: thanks for the questions. sorry if i sucked at the ama. first time jitters. for future hollers, please attempt me at @atmosphere on twitter."
569,"A fellow redditor from [r/loseit](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/) pointed out this subreddit to me when I posted there. Then I realized I've been on a Keto diet the past year of my life. He mentioned you guys might like my story, so I figured what the hell. Thanks, [Arclight](http://www.reddit.com/user/Arclight)!

So just a little *back* story on what I've been through the past year to drop the weight.. I woke up paralyzed from the bellybutton down about a year ago, due to a sports injury back in high school. A disk in my upper back was restricting my spinal cord; luckily it didn't sever. The funny thing is, I'm glad it happened; it changed my life forever. So a year later I'm 140+ lbs lighter, and probably 200% more in shape than what I was before the paralysis. This is all with zero surgery, really hard work, and little miracles. I truly am lucky! I may have lost a year of my life recovering, but I gained a lifetime of wisdom from it. If there's a lot of interest, I can edit this with what happened to cause this. 


I started my weight loss Journey with a 1200 calorie diet, which worked out really well. Once I started to plateau I switched to a low carb diet, called [Keto](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto). I allotted myself 20 carbs a day, which I mainly got from my coffee cream in the morning. You can eat all the protein you want, but the main structure of a meal is normally protein and a veggie, as well as a fiber. Exercise is key though, as it is with any sort of diet. You HAVE to stick with it, no matter what. You can come up with really lame excuses to why you shouldn't work out that day, but you're only hurting yourself in the long run. My exercise when I first started was walking around a tiny living room floor on my walker three times, then gradually increasing where I could walk the surface area of the house. Along with walking, I used a little motorized bicycle that I could use while sitting in my chair. Even though I couldn't lift my legs to pedal that bike yet, the pedals turned for me, so I was forced to endure the work out. I started with 5 minutes and worked my way up to 30 min cycles. What came next was swimming. It's literally the best work out you can get, and it's non-weight-bearing. The day I was able to walk up the steps to the pool is the day things accelerated, progress-wise. I swam laps for an hour straight and then ran in the pool for about 30 mins at first, then worked up to an hour. I got to the point where I did all of this every single day, no matter how sore or tired I was; I even kept adding on more time/reps. This sounds really crazy, but it's easy when you see progress. Losing weight gets addicting, trust me. You have to constantly push yourself, even if it's one more step. Those steps add up and it counts. The biggest thing to remember is you're not just dieting or working out, you're making a lifestyle change. 


These days I'm back to a weight training regiment; where I don't put a ton of pressure on my back, because that would basically be suicide. I'm also running for 45 mins a day around the neighborhood. Yup, running. No more walker, wheelchair, or any sort of assistance. 


The doctors told me I would never walk again. They literally said, look, you can get surgery on your back; however you would be taking a huge gamble. The chances were incredibly high that I would be paralyzed upon waking up; they also said if I didn't get surgery, that eventually I would be paralyzed. Obviously this devastated me, but one night it was like i flipped a switch. Instead of sitting around depressed that I'm morbidly obese and paralyzed; I literally said, ""I'm not going to live my life like this the rest of my days. There's no way in hell that this is it. Fuck that."" My experience made me believe in the power of human willpower. You can do anything you want in life, if you want it bad enough. Take me as living proof; I shouldn't be walking right now, let alone running.


The main reason I'm posting is to gain a little bit of motivation back. Life is amazing right now for me, I've even managed to bring an amazing woman into my life recently. She loves me more than anything, and it's for who I am, which to me is really beautiful; I honestly couldn't be happier. I figured if I couldn't get pumped up to go another 100 lbs, then perhaps I could inspire someone to change their life around, or even just to motivate them.

Anyways, I have a few progress pictures: 

* [430ish lbs](http://i.imgur.com/sYJi6KK.jpg) Not exactly my highest, but close. 
* [380 lbs](http://imgur.com/SCcLDEf) Don't mind that beastly mane. 
* [360 lbs](http://imgur.com/At6iLkz) 
* [320ish lbs](http://imgur.com/n2YpAqn) 

Here are some pictures of me within the last couple months: 

* A few face shots: [First](http://imgur.com/88XcTyz), and [Second](http://imgur.com/oUbiwsG). 

* These are the best body shots I have at the moment, I'll probably go take one after this post if it's requested; kind of cracking up that in three of these I have my black hoodie on. Damn you weather! [First](http://imgur.com/1wjbk3Q), [Second](http://imgur.com/P7DpMDO), and the [Third](http://imgur.com/TVIw8WA). Please don't mind that purple thing on the right.. it's obviously not my room, lol. I swear. 
* The [last](http://imgur.com/KBgwSoO) one for now; I know this is a douchey picture, but it's the only non-hoodied picture I have on me at this moment. I don't feel very photogenic, and generally don't take many pictures. I don't like the picture itself but I'm loving my shoulders so far, lol.

Thanks for reading :D I hope I could inspire some people with my journey, which isn't quite over yet, I'd like to lose another 100 lbs.. I would be pretty satisfied with 50 more as well. Any feedback or advice is most welcome :)

585,"I'd like recommendations for *really long* books/series to get invested in. Generally on the harder side (vs. space-opera), complex characters, and not SF/F. I've particularly enjoyed the following (long) works:

* Mars Trilogy (and related works)
* Dhalgren
* Foundation Trilogy
* Atlas Shrugged (philosophy aside)
* Infinite Jest (if you count this)

Specifically from authors other than the ones I've listed (since I'm familiar with the rest of their works).

I'm currently considering:

* Night's Dawn Trilogy
* Gravity's Rainbow

I think there are few words that feel as ugly and awkward as the word obese. Its the kind of word that always follows a sympathetic pause in the presence of the paunchy. It is so round and clinical and weighted down with taciturn lowness that it clings to a person in a way that squeezes and cripples him with what is simultaneously the most formidable and and the most elementary malady for a person to beat. January 5, marked one year since I resolved to change myself.This essay will probably be the most gushing and candid thing I’ve ever written, parts of this may seem attention seeking or boastful but I promise that this comes from the deepest, most sincere, and thought-worn parts of my heart. Its something I’ve had kicking around in my head for the better part of 15 years; this is the eulogy for my obesity.


Size has always dominated me, I began to chub around the fourth grade. I wouldn’t say that I was by any means a too-sad kid but I do think that feeling sad was a trigger for me. As a kid I had a difficult time finding a place where I felt like I was supposed to be. Whenever I would venture a try at something new, I would inevitably leave inadequate. I would feel bitter about being rejected by girls or I would feel sad about not being able to keep up with boys. In response I withdrew and went to food. As I grew up, I never felt right and I never I had anything that was mine with which to excel…I would fantasize about accomplishment and taking ownership of the kind of charisma and strength that would enamour me to those girls and make myself a hero in the minds of those guys, but I had lost so much ground over time that the idea of changing anything was daunting. It felt like my life was looming over me and I used food and humor as a means to swat it.


Gaining weight was mostly gradual with a few sharp spikes. It went on slowly until one day I realized that I was a fat kid and at once the idea got stuck in my head. I remember this feeling of compliance like:""well, this is me now."" As I grew older and boundaries widened, I became heavier. I would ride my bike to the Meijer on Clyde Park when it had a McDonalds in it and I would eat a Double Quarter meal Super-Sized and a twenty-piece chicken nuggets, turn around and ride home. This secret meal would lay on top of everything else I eaten during the day and I would enjoy it with stealth in my mind. It didn’t help that I was also slow to develop socially; I didn't have friends yet and food became music for me. It entertained and occupied me. I would go to movies by myself (which I loved doing) I would devour my lonely popcorn and inhale my propitious Pepsi. With every little bit of freedom I enjoyed, my weight gain would apex and level off. When I got my first job (at a pizza joint) I had tons of free food and money to spend on whatever I liked, when I got my license I could travel farther for different brands and combinations of fast food. Every bit of independance further cemented my habits.


Eventually I did develop a bit of a social lean but I still had a hard time accepting myself to my peers, I always felt like my stature stood between us. For example, one year we went to Michigan Adventure, I hadn’t thought much about the seat in a roller coaster and and never had a problem with a lap bar, but then I got in line for The Corkscrew. We waited eagerly and when the time came I walked up to the cart and looked inside and I thought ""shit."" I sat down next to a friend and it was tight but we were both able to sit. I reach up to pull down the shoulder harness and it wouldn’t click. My chest is too far from my back to get the harness to lock. I want to get out but instead an employee comes to me and tries to help by pressing it into me while I 'suck it in' No dice. I stood up and walked away with all the eyes on my back. I held the ride up and I was that fat kid that didn’t fit so I watched my friends ride the coaster from the sidewalk. It was the first time my size made me feel t isolated in front of someone. My attitude was to quietly tack roller coasters on to a list of things I couldn’t do. Eventually I out grew movie theater seats, airplane seats, and ‘Big & Tall’ sections in the mall and I passively waved goodbye to all of them.


And time just passed by - I built powerful, lasting, and comfortable relationships. I worked and had fun but never really achieved anything. I had quiet goals but all of the things I wanted for myself came to be plain conversational fodder, things you get drunk and dream about out loud. Everything I wanted was so public and everything I was was so private. I wanted to act and I wanted to be a comedian. I did open mics and it left me disgusted and exposed, it was a sort of exhilarating misery that kept you facing the goals you pushed away. I gradually lost momentum and just sort of stalled. Life for a few years was like a room dimly lit by the flickering light of a TV. It was quiet, and private, and comfortable. I remained stealthily obsessed with food. It occupied my mind. The flavors and textures and that feeling of occupation in your core gave me a sense of contentment that was so durable that it became ever-present in my life.


I haven’t always lacked a sense of the need for change. Periodically, I would have manic bouts of conviction and backbone. I would face the world and strive to be social, and better, and healthy. I would purse comedy again, I joined gyms, I sought and gained relationships...complacency though eventually had me back in my room eroding from a habit bordering agoraphobia. Eventually I realized that I wasn’t the possessor friends I once was and I became aware of the cheerlessness I felt for myself and that revealed to me the delicacy of the relationships I had. I was pushing people away from me so that I could revel in my faults. I began to see the folly and futility of so many of the years behind me. I became morbidly mindful of my mortality; I would imagine a roommate finding me dead and how they would react. How my family would react. In that, I realized that I’d lived so absent mindedly for so long that I had become OK with being dead when I was 40 and had subconsciously planned to be alone and idle for whatever time I had left. I’d let indulgence and apathy become intuitive.


A dramatic shift in my mindset came to pass around summer 2011. It was also around this time that I, as none of my friends or family knew, auditioned for a weight loss reality show. On the show, overweight men and women are taken away to a fitness sanctuary where they are taught healthy habits and exercise and exercise and exercise ... it was much like a real-life adult version of the movie Heavyweights. While gone, participants don’t communicate with family or friends and then, after an agonizing and heart lifting episode is complete, they are revealed to friends and family in a new body and attitude. I wanted to be a part of that show and thought I had it. I was interviewed and inline to be a part of the show when, abruptly, the series was put on hold and the new season never materialized.

I was devastated. I had poured my future into this idea that I could be taken away and fixed. That I was going to leave and come back as a new person for everyone to hold up cheer for. I had built up tremendous optimism and lost it all just as quickly. I went right back onto the destructive beat I had just left. Looking back, not making it on that show broke something for me and pushed me to get bad enough that I could get better.


Fortunately it only took about six months, I grieved the loss of my spotlight and my champion transformative moment and during that time reflected soulfully about who I am to the people in my life, who I am to myself, and most importantly recognized that I have it in myself to become the kind of person I want to be: I want to constantly be aware of my potential. I want to be a man that knows and practices right from wrong. I want to modestly inspire goodness, optimism, and effort in people; I want my integrity and my character to be something worth holding up. I want to be external and in the lives of people and I want people to feel that having me in their lives is a thing of value. In order to realize these things I had to accept accountability for what had misrepresented my capability and demeaned my resolve for so long. It wasn’t my weight, it was my attitude about life and an enduring lack of enthusiasm for the future.


I took responsibility for my well being one year ago, I weighed 420 pounds, I wore a XXXXXL dress shirt and 48 jeans. My life and the way I lived it literally changed overnight and hasn’t stumbled. I began by eating a calorie restricted diet and eventually shifted to focus on lower carbohydrates. For exercise I started by walking three miles a day. I would take the bus to school, get off walk a ways and get back on further down the route. Once spring rolled around I began to bike. Those rides progressed from two, to six, to ten mile rides, mostly to and from school. Soon the distance between school and home wasn’t clear or long enough so riding became a purposeful thing rather than utility. I rode and rode. By the end of the summer I had joined the half century club having ridden over fifty miles in one ride. In August I began running using the Couch to 5k program and ran my first full 5k on November 17 and putted along to finish my first 10k on December 15. As of today I have lost 178 pounds, wear a large and 34 jeans. I am stronger and faster than I’ve ever felt myself be. I feel appreciation and optimism in everything that I do and I sense that this is the way life should feel. I’ve still got a lot of work to do but at this point the habits have rooted and the education that I’ve gained over the last year will nurture them. I cannot see my life going backwards, this is who I was always supposed to be.


I’ve spent most of my life planning and daydreaming without action and now everything seems so attainable.This is why I write today, I’m ready to say goodbye to that old life now and to focus on maintaining goal oriented momentum and pushing harder so that the strength in my musings becomes the strength in my character. I can do better, I can do better. I can be the Greatest Man in the World.


Thank you to Mom, my Dad, Jerry, My brothers Eric and Adam, Jessica, Marshall, Corey, Colby; you guys specifically have given me clarity and always been frank with be about delicate things. And to Britt, Allen, Jen, Margie, and Alex, you guys give me the happiness I need to suck it up and do it. This might all seem overly sentimental but I only plan on doing this once and you’ve changed my life in ways that can’t really make sense to you.


Part of the audition process for the reality show I mentioned was to create a series of videos focusing on different aspects of my life. I edited one of them and am keeping a few private, but as for the rest, I don’t see a reason to keep it closeted anymore, I feel like that person is gone now. I uploaded these in May 2011, until now it has been accessible only to the producers of the show. For those interested, I have the links listed below. I think they are a thought-provoking relic.

590,"I came across this article on Lentils in the Chicago Times the other day: http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-09-29/features/sc-food-0924-prep-lentils-20100929_1_lentils-beans-bacon 

Rather than being a typical recipe, that gives you really specific ingredients and instructions, it's more of a loose guide to cooking lentils. (I'm specifically talking about the 'The Steps You Take Section' as opposed to the actual recipe at the bottom of the article). I really like how they sort of build in variations and substitutions, and you can easily figure out what are the fundamental steps to braising lentils versus where you can get creative.

Right now, when I start looking into a dish I haven't cooked before I find I end up sussing this out by looking at a bunch of different recipes for the dish. But it's a fairly time consuming process, and it seems like there are a lot of shitty recipes out there.

Do y'all have any good sources of recipes that are more this style of giving you a technique for cooking a dish rather than a more regimented recipe?"

Did I take that message too literally? Ah well. 

Well I am not going to lie, I have been looking forward to this event ever since I heard about it ohh so long ago. And here we are! So let us get this gravy train wreck a-rollin!

My name is Travis, I am told I am 24 years old, I live In Minnesota, and I work for Suncountry Airlines as a Catering Assistant! I currently live with three other amazing friends in a house over in Bloomington. We have (much to my own dismay) 3 felines living with us as well. Soon I plan on getting a dog. 

I absolutely love the winter, and look forward to making Phoenix Snowmen every year! 

My hobbies include Archery, Swordsmanship, Giving away most of my gross income as spite gifts (looking at *you* Shellbullet17), Tabletop gaming, rollerblading, snowboarding, drawing, NERF, and finding the quickest most efficient way to be as lazy as possible. Oh, and Ponies. 

I fill most of my days playing games and hanging out with friends through various means. Mostly playing games. Most of these games are board and card games, and many of them are made by Fantasy Flight and other big name game companies. For non board or card related games I have been on a Borderlands 2 binge as of late. 

Events I plan to attend to in the next several months include a Lindsey Stirling Tour, Anime Detour, CONvergence, and a camping trip or 6. 

Things I would like to accomplish and gain from this thread: Friends! Glorious friends! I would love to share stories and learn a little about you all as well. After all, you are all amazing. And let us face it, my res tags are terribly, horribly lacking.

626,"The further along I climb in this transformation from AFC to the most awesome version of myself I can be, the more I realize that 'the main battle is the battle with my scumbag brain'. The theory I read here and on RSD Nation have shown me the light, but moving toward it has been a difficult struggle to beat back a lot of my past social conditioning and limiting beliefs.

I've known this girl for a bit less than 2 years. She just turned 18, senior in high school. I am almost 19, a college sophomore (skipped a grade). When I first met her, I had a SERIOUS case of one-itis. I thought about her pretty much all day for a couple months while I was away during my freshman year. We hung out during spring break last year and I was ridiculously AFC back then - seeking validation from her, saying things I thought she wanted to hear, did not make a move, etc. The whole deal. It's a wonder she still wanted to hang out with me after that!

Fast forward to now: My inner game has improved tremendously since then. I meditate. I don't fap (shameless plug for NoFap here, I think the benefits are very real). I am self-amused and better at creating my own fun rather than taking it from others. I no longer get one-itis for girls. As for results since then, I've had 2 K-Closes and a handjob. Nothing special I suppose, but I still feel I've come a long way and am on the right track.

What happened today: She comes over to my place so that we can go hiking in the canyon by my house. I start off kino right off the bat by giving her one of those half-hugs (definitely should have gone more all out. I would have, but I chickened out because it didn't seem like she was expecting one. Gotta remember to just lead!)  We're both kind of intellectual people, so from past experience I knew conversations would likely tend in that direction (think books, commentary on culture and society, politics etc) . So this time I tried to change things up more and talk about random things or animals I saw in the canyon, and joke more. Probably should have done more with this. We run into one of her best friends on the trail and her friend sort of insinuated that they've talked about me before. Whatever haha. I was doing a lot of things to reinforce self-amusement by stopping randomly to look and comment about different sights, and kino'ed her occasionally.

Now the interesting part: So we're back at my house, alone, just eating clementines and chillin. I tried to ingrain this in my head before we met up: ""Just push boundaries, your ego doesn't matter."" I read an inspiring quote by Roosh V from his book, BANG: ""Girls reward aggressive guys who want to have sex with them, not timid guys who wait for pussy to fall from the sky"". Despite what I KNEW I should do - just stop her mid-sentence, go up to her and start kissing her - I couldn't bring myself to do it! Scumbag brain in action!! Just stood there a couple of feet away from her, chatting.  

I couldn't take this mental torture any more so I just start walking toward the door, implying that it's time for her to go. Right in front of the door, she tells me, ""I had a great time"" or something. In a burst of semi-courage, I go up to her, give her a hug, pull back a bit then say ""There's something in your teeth let me get that"" then just go in for the kiss. My lips meet her lips! Oh shit is this really happening? I release after maybe 2 seconds.   

She smiles (at least I think she did) and says ""What's in my teeth""? At this point I lost a lot of presence and wasn't really in control of myself anymore, I think since I'm just not used to being in this kind of situation. I tell her ""A piece of orange skin"" then fumble to open the door. To diffuse the situation I laugh and say ""That's probably the cheesiest thing I've ever done."" Honestly, I don't really remember what transpired after that. I think she just said ""It's cool haha, see you next time"" and walked out. 

I text her later, ""It was fun spending time with you today. See you soon, have fun this semester"" and she responds, ""Likewise! Haha I hope you have fun too. (Cat emoji)""

REFLECTION: Was it pretty awkward at the end? Yea. Did she notice my discomfort and probably infer from that I'm inexperienced around girls? Yea probably. But FUCK IT MAN GOTTA DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO. This experience was worth probably a whole book on theory, because the best way to build up a strong model of reality is through FIRST HAND EXPERIENCES THAT TEACH LESSONS. My life is an experiment, and now I have another reference experience to assimilate into my reality. Next time I'm in a similar situation, I KNOW I'll have the balls to go for it in the middle of the interaction rather than just waiting until the end (and go for it with more aggression and presence) because I'm all about progress and the feeling that if I chicken out, then I did not improve from last time will outweigh the nervousness I may feel. It's a GRADUAL process for sure but I'm proud of my success today (failure would have been to not go for the K-Close at all, that was not an option because I KNEW I would feel like shit if I didn't)

Sorry for the ramble and bad grammar but I'm just getting stuff out there stream-of-consciousness style. That's about all I have! So hope this was at least a bit interesting/inspiring and KEEP KILLIN IT, YOU HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR BUT FEAR ITSELF!!

630,"After getting a little more gear on my monk (stuck at 468 ilvl :( ) I decided it was time to try soloing some old content. It really wasn't easy at first but I think I finally got a rhythm down by the end

Primarily I was running as windwalker. I feel like it's actually pretty close to a blood spec DK in terms of survivability. Not QUITE as good, but certainly better than soloing with a frost DK. 

Last night I decided to start off with ICC 10. 

Trash was a non-issue. I actually skipped a bunch of it with flying serpent kick as it was still spawning.

Marrowgar was ALMOST a fail. I learned a few very important lessons on him....

* Cast chi wave every freeking time it's up. period. 

* same goes for expel harm

* glyph of blackout kick is really stupid to use when soloing

that last one should have been obvious but I forgot I had it :P. Either way, downed him and proceeded to rape deathwhisper's trash.

The lady went down like a classy hooker, no problems and no new lessons there. Had her mana bubble down before the second wave of adds

GUNSHIP!~~

This was more a lesson on the fight itself than the monk class. And YES you can solo it, at least on 10m normal. And it's quite easy

* Start in a turret, and gun the ship as soon as you see it. you don't see the HP bars but it is taking damage

* when the guns freeze, wait on your ship for the 3 adds to come through the portal. Once you kill the dude in grand marshal armor (gold/yellow) jump over to the alliance ship. Kill the mage, kill 1 or 2 riflemen as you walk by them, and hop back and go right back into the cannon. 

* repeat. but be as FAST as you can

Yay gunship down! Then came saurfang... I was actually quite worried about him and he took me a few tries to get down. 

he puts out a LOT of damage, but it's also very steady rather than bursty. I did give him a shot as windwalker but I had to switch to brewmaster to get the kill

As long as I kept up shuffle and used chi wave every time it was up, between that and blackout kicks I was able to stay above 70% hp. Once guard came up, the heal buff would allow me to get back to 100%. When he was down to 10% or so and started going berserk I dropped xuen to taunt off me. As long as I dropped the bloodbeasts ASAP and watched my rotations very carefully it was easy peasey

The entire plague wing was easy as Windwalker, no issues at all there. Had to try putricide twice but besides that not a problem at all.

And that's where I stopped for the night

Tonight I might go clear ulduar for the achievements (missing 2) and I'm going to give ToC a shot as well. if I'm feeling brave I might give some 85 content a try"

632,"Since I started following r/writing I have learned the following:

1. Show, don't tell.

2. Adverbs are bad, mkay?

3. Hemingway was a genius.


So I tried to show and not tell. I tried to work around the adverbs. And I decided to read Hemingway.

I picked up Hemingway's ""The Sun Also Rises"", his debut novel. And I'll be darned... He was telling, not showing, like there was no tomorrow! And he was using adverbs!

From Wikipedia:
>The New York Times wrote in 1926 of Hemingway's first novel, ""No amount of analysis can convey the quality of The Sun Also Rises. It is a truly gripping story, told in a lean, hard, athletic narrative prose that puts more literary English to shame."" The Sun Also Rises is written in spare, tight prose that influenced countless crime and pulp fiction novels and made Hemingway famous.

So just know this: If you bend over backwards to follow the tips and rules people so graciously share with you, you ain't going to be no Hemingway. So just plop your ass down in front of that screen or paper and start goddamn writing!"

634,"Four months ago, I weighed 420 pounds. I was miserable, I could barely do anything physical without stopping to sit. I convinced myself that I wasn't one of 'those' people because I refused to ride the electric carts when shopping and I still got out and did things. But I wanted to be healthier, so I started on a new diet to restart my near-dead metabolism.

Last month, my mother got me a YMCA membership and enrollment in their Moving Forward class (formerly called the Y-est Loser). I weighed in at 398 pounds. Lighter, but no more fit than before. In the opening tests, I barely made it a half-mile before I nearly collapsed. The class deals with both diet and exercise. I modified my diet and went to the class twice a week.

Today I went in early wanting to exercise before the nutrition classes. I decided to warm up with the half mile that had abused me before. I noticed I was moving faster and easier than before. After the half mile, I realized I could keep going. I decided to see how far I could go.

I walked the whole mile without stopping.

After reporting it to my coaches, I approached the scale. I don't weigh myself regularly so I don't get discouraged by fluctuations. I stepped on it and almost burst out crying.

382.

Hearing this, the director of the local YMCA asked if he could showcase my weight loss journey as it happens, and asked if I would become a fundraising Champion. I signed on immediately.  (Not sure if /r/loseit would frown on a fundraising link from my YMCA or not, let me know)

Today I had the pleasure of updating my flair. It's been an amazing journey already, and I'm only 20 days in. If you're considering making a go at weight loss, stop waiting. I feel amazing, and I'm improving every day."
635,"Hi. I'm a Junior in highschool and I've always called myself a Christian. But within the last year, a new youth pastor came to our church and he has helped me so much with my faith. I had a lot of problems, before he came around, but ignored them saying things like ""God will help me"" and ""I'll ask for forgiveness later"". I am actually sickened with who I was. But over this winter break, my Youth pastor challenged all his students to try and read the entire Bible over that break. I was 1 of 2, which broke my heart. He chose to read with us. While I must say, the Bible is BY FAR the HARDEST book I have EVER read, I sadly did not finish. Winter break is over, but I feel so much closer to God because of what he asked me to do and his encouragement the whole way. I plan on finishing reading it, with my trusty highlighter in one hand and my Bible in the other!

Anyway, sorry if I bored any of you, but I wanted to share my story. I don't talk to anybody about my problems and stuff, and I was hoping that maybe it would be easier to discuss to a stranger as opposed to somebody in person who may judge me. :)"

I did find it was a tough book to read, and pages ~100-~300 were a bit of a slog.

648,"Some less orthodox Mormons admit the possibility that the Book of Mormon isn't literally ""true"" but suggest nevertheless that it is an ""inspired"" text. Of course, almost any orthodox Mormon will agree that the text is inspired.

I submit that the Book of Mormon is ugly, tedious, arbitrary, morally vacuous, and puerile. In short, not ""inspired,"" but far from it. While there is a large measure of subjectivity in this kind of assessment, arguments with potentially broad appeal can be made on these points, so I will make a case.

**Note**: This is a resubmission with a modified title by the request of a subscriber. 

Everybody's input on this topic is welcome, though remember that the scope of this debate is limited to whether the Book of Mormon is ""inspired"" even if not a true historical account.

652,"It's been about 5 years since I left the faith, and for the past few months I've been becoming aware of some serious voids left in my post-Christian life. One thing I loved about church in my believing days was that there was no lack of older, wiser people who could council and reassure me. In high school and even college I met one-on-one regularly with church leaders, and it really helped keep me grounded. Now I just want to be influenced by someone on how to live a healthy, secular life. I don't even know where to begin looking. With Christianity it was so simple, but now I wouldn't have the slightest clue how to approach someone about such a relationship."

685,"I'm nearly done with Pandora's star, and to be honest, I found it a labour to read. I found Hamilton's writing style read like a teenage soap-opera novel and focused on a lot of trivial details (e.g. the model numbers for train engines). I don't say this to act like some kind of authority on sci-fi writing, but to give you an idea of my preferences. 

So what I'm looking for from you fine people is a good read that involves interaction with alien races (and not just in the *they're trying to kill us* way). Perhaps they're our allies (in some kind of UN), our stewards - overseeing our development, our trade partners... just some kind of *interesting* narrative that involves alien races interacting with humanity.

702,"Growing up evangelical, I always assumed that the purpose of preaching was primarily to convict and challenge people. The criticism I've received from my mainline denominational higher-ups is ""Where's the good news in your sermon?"" I'm reading a preaching book right now with my senior pastor that raises some of these questions so I thought I'd blog about what preaching's primary purpose should be.

My current ""social expansion routine(if you will). Is forcing myself to talk to at least one new person everyday. The quality of conversation matters now(boy or girl, does not matter). 

But recently I have begun to feel that just talking and starting up random conversations with strangers isn't getting me anywhere. In fact it feels like it is too ""easy"". 

Should I keep it up? Should I take it upon myself to challenge myself more? If so do you guys have any reccomendations?

704,"I want to say yes. Right now the wind is whipping around, with flurries, and really darkly overcasted. I dont know if that makes things worse for me... like if it were 80 and sunny, everything wouldnt bother me so much...

Daughter and I woke up late, missed her WIC appointment, so we are kinda SOL till the end of the week for that. Boo. She has been sicky for the last 8 or 9 days, but has been cuddling her new beanie baby that white_tiger got her yesterday, and just clingy like no other. 

Still no word on the job ive been working on getting for 4+ months. Im hoping they just havent made calls yet. Im pretty upset about that. i really thought I would get the job, and be able to quit the hell hole I currently work in. But I have my workers comp doctors visit today to either get my restrictions lifted or keep them where they are. At this point, I dont care what they decide to do. 

Then there is this whole ordeal with this low income weatherization of my house. They came last week, peeked around, and said ""Nope, cant do it... gunna have to have the state look at it."" So when I called today to check in on that, they said it wont be till the end of the week for that, too... but they said if the state worker cant figure it out, they will defer me, and that 2 years i sat on the waiting list will be for nothing. I wont have a energy efficient, insulated home, because they couldnt install something that does NOTHING with insulation or energy efficiency. 

Im just bummed, all the way around. But I dont think I would be so upset if it were middle of the summer. Then again, I wouldnt be getting 600$ utility bills either. 

Seriously, it needs to warm up and get sunny. Cabin fever will be the death of me and most of us here in the dreaded mitten state.

710,"My thoughts on being a Fat Girl, and why it's Okay.

In the shower last night, I thought of an upside to being a Fat Girl.

There are a few girls out there who automatically dislike pretty girls. This is due to subconscious insecurity and the unconscious feeling that these pretty girls are a threat to their own self worth, femininity and attractiveness.

However, as a fat girl, I do not pose such a threat.

I am automatically non-threatening because I don’t fit standard beauty definitions of facial symmetry and low body fat percentage.

Which is an upside. I’m generally pretty shy, so I don’t need anything that prevents people from talking to me. ‘Cause god knows how unlikely it is for me to start a conversation.

Thinking about this lead me to think about what it is to be a Fat Girl in general.

Now. Don't tell me that I'm not fat.

Dude, I own mirrors. Also a scale and a tape measure if you want some empirical numbers.

I am not within the average weight range for my height, age or gender. Nor have I ever been, really.

I know that my friends who tell me I'm not fat do it because they care about me. They don't want me to feel poorly about myself and I appreciate that. But, it's a lie. And lying to me doesn't help me. Especially because knowing I'm fat doesn't make me feel bad about myself.

Because it's not necessarily a Bad Thing.

I am healthy. I can run if I have to. I enjoy the elliptical machine if I have an audiobook. I look forward to my 45 minute walk to school every morning. I love hot yoga.

But, I doubt I will ever have a flat stomach. My thighs will probably always touch. My hips will always be rounded. My arms will never be completely toned.

Maybe I don’t have enough self control.

I’ve tried diets. The low carb one worked pretty well. But I’m still trying to decide if the 10 lbs I lost were worth me coming near to tears in the grocery store because I couldn’t even find soup that didn’t have carbs. I denied myself so many simple things that made me happy.

Right now, while I’m worrying about school and my future, It’s not worth it. So, I’m not on any diet, aside from the poor student on campus budget. Maybe I’ll try again in April. But not now.

And even so, it doesn’t matter.

I may be fat, but I’m happy.

My boyfriend loves my “thick thighs” and nuzzles into my slightly pillowy stomach whenever I will let him. He still thought I was sexy when I was at my heaviest.

But more importantly, I think I’m sexy. I love my body. I like myself. My body is not just an aspect of me, it is me.

I am strong. I am sturdy. I am balanced.

I am fat.

I know this. I accept this as an objective fact. It is not a slight against my character. It does not make me less than others.

It makes me who I am. Growing up in this specific body, learning to love and accept myself as is, has given me a unique perspective on the world that no one else has.

When I say this out loud, and people tell me that I’m not fat, it takes a bit of that journey away from me.

I know exactly who and what I am, and it took me a long time to get here.

I am a Fat Girl. But that does not mean that I cannot also be a Pretty Girl.


_____________________________________________________________



EDIT: Holy balls. I put this up just so I didn't feel so much like I was talking to myself, and it blew up while I was at work!

This was originally posted on my tumblr and it was mostly ignored because no one follows me. (HIGHLY NSFW. SERIOUSLY I POST PORN SOMETIMES) http://embersinmyeyes.tumblr.com/

I love this community. Everyone is so supportive and loving and wonderful. Thank you so much to /u/DylanMcDermott who bought me some reddit gold! <3 It's really cool actually! <3

To the people who don't feel so great about their looks: you're beautiful. No matter what you look like, I'm willing to bet money that there's something about you that another person would kill for.

It took me a while to figure out how I could be happy. And it mostly involves mentally telling the people who put me down to go fuck themselves with a cactus.

And I want to be clear that I am all for dieting and exercising and all that wonderful weight loss stuff, as long as it makes you happy. I know a lot of people who get extreme joy out of the time they spend working on their bodies, and all power to 'em! 

My comment was simply that it did not make me happy. So much so that dieting actually brought me legitimate despair.

I don't overeat, aside from the odd celebratory buffet after a semester ends. I eat healthy foods. I don't drink Coke anymore or other sugary drinks since I discovered tea. I get at least 45 minutes of some kind of exercise on most days. The issue with me is that I got fat as a child. My parents didn't really stop me when I wanted 2 Hungry Man dinners for lunch (900 calories each, by the way). I got fat long before I realized how terrible it could be for me.

So at this point, my exercise and eating habits mean I maintain my current weight without much consideration. It's the loss of weight that is hard for me. That's where I begin to feel like I'm no longer enjoying my life.

'Cause that's all I want. I want to be happy. And hardcore keto diets do not make me happy.   

The TwoX community makes me happy. I love the discussions here and the kindness. I don't see as much kindness in the world as I'd like to, except when I'm here.

Plus, I've only been called a cunt once this whole thread! Which is nice. Because I mean, who doesn't like vaginas? Cunts are all about depth, warmth, fun and life! 

Haters can take a step to the left. Healthy girls are beautiful, regardless of if you are tiny or large or any shape at all."
711,"I read a book lately: Ready Player One by Ernest Cline. Gaming Sci-fi. Fun and lighthearted. It tells the story of a boy who plays a game every moment of his life because it gives him hope.

Until the end, I didn't understand that I, too was living in a simulation.

My simulation encompasses nearly every living moment. It's Magic: The Gathering. It's books. It's TV. It's YouTube. It's this fucking site right here that I spend hours glued to.

My simulation is tailored perfectly to my interests. It's a bubble of satisfaction and distraction. It's a place where I can solve immense problems creatively and hear moving, deeply human stories. In my simulation, life is easy and there are so many good things to do.

But in the real world I have grown weak. I've become recalcitrant to discipline, and even the most menial tasks-- organizing my binders for classes, for example-- are postponed for days. I'm more socially awkward now than I was in high school. I've been in college for several months now, and I haven't even gotten a girl's number. I can't face myself in the mirror. I can't live like this anymore. 

As long as I use media to escape my problems, I will be dead inside.

When I look away from my phone and computer and out of my window, I remember my dreams. I want to be a distance runner and a biologist and a lover and a father and everyone's favorite goofy drunk. I want faces, not usernames. I want hugs, not that fucking Reddit Gold crap.

So goodbye, Reddit. You've been wonderful, but I have things to do and be. Where I'm going, there's no room for imaginary friends.

741,"I started this process in June of 2012. The first 140+ day streak was 'broken' when I had to submit a semen test, so that really disappointed me, but I continued on towards my second 90 day goal.  90 days has now come and gone, and how do I feel this second time around?

More energy continues.
Depression symptoms are less and less, but it has been a slow, long, steady climb.
I'm getting noticed more by girls.  I think the reason for this is that I am not giving off that 'needy' energy.  Where in the past I may have tried too hard, or lingered too long, or paid them too much attention - now I 'dont care'. This is probobly attractive.  Anyway, my objective is not to lure women as I'm already taken, but only to better myself. The attention of women is only an indicator that I monitor.

All this change has been compounded by the fact that I am working out, getting sleep and eating super clean. Also making a real effort to socialize more.

In the past 90 days I have had one wet dream, but my libido is dull, probably by antidepressants, which I am fine with for now.  So I'll continue with the flatline and consider removing antidepressants in the summer if this progress continues.

It's also not a bad idea to engage the services of a sex therapist who can help guide you in this process, particularly for those whose addiction was deep and long standing.  I meet with mine on occasion and this has been a useful tool, not only to help with the immediate issue of fapping but also to help discover and pick apart what we hold true about our sexuality in general.  It is these truths that we hold onto that govern our actions. It's nice to reverse-engineer these to see if we can make any tweaks, or change our perspective.

Stay strong everyone.  Channel the desire into positive action and you will build a great confidence."

In just over a year she's lost 34 lbs, and now she's training for a half marathon.
She now weighs 120 lbs.

Further to that, in just over a year, thanks to her I've lost 45 lbs.
I now weigh ~148 lbs, and I'm starting to work up to running a 10k.

So how did we do it?

Well, exercise and portion control, eating a sensible amount of food made a huge difference.
Epecially rice and pasta.
She also got me into running, which is something I'd never done before.

I think there are few words that feel as ugly and awkward as the word obese. Its the kind of word that always follows a sympathetic pause in the presence of the paunchy. It is so round and clinical and weighted down with taciturn lowness that it clings to a person in a way that squeezes and cripples him with what is simultaneously the most formidable and and the most elementary malady for a person to beat. January 5, marked one year since I resolved to change myself.This essay will probably be the most gushing and candid thing I’ve ever written, parts of this may seem attention seeking or boastful but I promise that this comes from the deepest, most sincere, and thought-worn parts of my heart. Its something I’ve had kicking around in my head for the better part of 15 years; this is the eulogy for my obesity.


Size has always dominated me, I began to chub around the fourth grade. I wouldn’t say that I was by any means a too-sad kid but I do think that feeling sad was a trigger for me. As a kid I had a difficult time finding a place where I felt like I was supposed to be. Whenever I would venture a try at something new, I would inevitably leave inadequate. I would feel bitter about being rejected by girls or I would feel sad about not being able to keep up with boys. In response I withdrew and went to food. As I grew up, I never felt right and I never I had anything that was mine with which to excel…I would fantasize about accomplishment and taking ownership of the kind of charisma and strength that would enamour me to those girls and make myself a hero in the minds of those guys, but I had lost so much ground over time that the idea of changing anything was daunting. It felt like my life was looming over me and I used food and humor as a means to swat it.


Gaining weight was mostly gradual with a few sharp spikes. It went on slowly until one day I realized that I was a fat kid and at once the idea got stuck in my head. I remember this feeling of compliance like:""well, this is me now."" As I grew older and boundaries widened, I became heavier. I would ride my bike to the Meijer on Clyde Park when it had a McDonalds in it and I would eat a Double Quarter meal Super-Sized and a twenty-piece chicken nuggets, turn around and ride home. This secret meal would lay on top of everything else I eaten during the day and I would enjoy it with stealth in my mind. It didn’t help that I was also slow to develop socially; I didn't have friends yet and food became music for me. It entertained and occupied me. I would go to movies by myself (which I loved doing) I would devour my lonely popcorn and inhale my propitious Pepsi. With every little bit of freedom I enjoyed, my weight gain would apex and level off. When I got my first job (at a pizza joint) I had tons of free food and money to spend on whatever I liked, when I got my license I could travel farther for different brands and combinations of fast food. Every bit of independance further cemented my habits.


Eventually I did develop a bit of a social lean but I still had a hard time accepting myself to my peers, I always felt like my stature stood between us. For example, one year we went to Michigan Adventure, I hadn’t thought much about the seat in a roller coaster and and never had a problem with a lap bar, but then I got in line for The Corkscrew. We waited eagerly and when the time came I walked up to the cart and looked inside and I thought ""shit."" I sat down next to a friend and it was tight but we were both able to sit. I reach up to pull down the shoulder harness and it wouldn’t click. My chest is too far from my back to get the harness to lock. I want to get out but instead an employee comes to me and tries to help by pressing it into me while I 'suck it in' No dice. I stood up and walked away with all the eyes on my back. I held the ride up and I was that fat kid that didn’t fit so I watched my friends ride the coaster from the sidewalk. It was the first time my size made me feel t isolated in front of someone. My attitude was to quietly tack roller coasters on to a list of things I couldn’t do. Eventually I out grew movie theater seats, airplane seats, and ‘Big & Tall’ sections in the mall and I passively waved goodbye to all of them.


And time just passed by - I built powerful, lasting, and comfortable relationships. I worked and had fun but never really achieved anything. I had quiet goals but all of the things I wanted for myself came to be plain conversational fodder, things you get drunk and dream about out loud. Everything I wanted was so public and everything I was was so private. I wanted to act and I wanted to be a comedian. I did open mics and it left me disgusted and exposed, it was a sort of exhilarating misery that kept you facing the goals you pushed away. I gradually lost momentum and just sort of stalled. Life for a few years was like a room dimly lit by the flickering light of a TV. It was quiet, and private, and comfortable. I remained stealthily obsessed with food. It occupied my mind. The flavors and textures and that feeling of occupation in your core gave me a sense of contentment that was so durable that it became ever-present in my life.


I haven’t always lacked a sense of the need for change. Periodically, I would have manic bouts of conviction and backbone. I would face the world and strive to be social, and better, and healthy. I would purse comedy again, I joined gyms, I sought and gained relationships...complacency though eventually had me back in my room eroding from a habit bordering agoraphobia. Eventually I realized that I wasn’t the possessor friends I once was and I became aware of the cheerlessness I felt for myself and that revealed to me the delicacy of the relationships I had. I was pushing people away from me so that I could revel in my faults. I began to see the folly and futility of so many of the years behind me. I became morbidly mindful of my mortality; I would imagine a roommate finding me dead and how they would react. How my family would react. In that, I realized that I’d lived so absent mindedly for so long that I had become OK with being dead when I was 40 and had subconsciously planned to be alone and idle for whatever time I had left. I’d let indulgence and apathy become intuitive.


A dramatic shift in my mindset came to pass around summer 2011. It was also around this time that I, as none of my friends or family knew, auditioned for a weight loss reality show. On the show, overweight men and women are taken away to a fitness sanctuary where they are taught healthy habits and exercise and exercise and exercise ... it was much like a real-life adult version of the movie Heavyweights. While gone, participants don’t communicate with family or friends and then, after an agonizing and heart lifting episode is complete, they are revealed to friends and family in a new body and attitude. I wanted to be a part of that show and thought I had it. I was interviewed and inline to be a part of the show when, abruptly, the series was put on hold and the new season never materialized.

I was devastated. I had poured my future into this idea that I could be taken away and fixed. That I was going to leave and come back as a new person for everyone to hold up cheer for. I had built up tremendous optimism and lost it all just as quickly. I went right back onto the destructive beat I had just left. Looking back, not making it on that show broke something for me and pushed me to get bad enough that I could get better.


Fortunately it only took about six months, I grieved the loss of my spotlight and my champion transformative moment and during that time reflected soulfully about who I am to the people in my life, who I am to myself, and most importantly recognized that I have it in myself to become the kind of person I want to be: I want to constantly be aware of my potential. I want to be a man that knows and practices right from wrong. I want to modestly inspire goodness, optimism, and effort in people; I want my integrity and my character to be something worth holding up. I want to be external and in the lives of people and I want people to feel that having me in their lives is a thing of value. In order to realize these things I had to accept accountability for what had misrepresented my capability and demeaned my resolve for so long. It wasn’t my weight, it was my attitude about life and an enduring lack of enthusiasm for the future.


I took responsibility for my well being one year ago, I weighed 420 pounds, I wore a XXXXXL dress shirt and 48 jeans. My life and the way I lived it literally changed overnight and hasn’t stumbled. I began by eating a calorie restricted diet and eventually shifted to focus on lower carbohydrates. For exercise I started by walking three miles a day. I would take the bus to school, get off walk a ways and get back on further down the route. Once spring rolled around I began to bike. Those rides progressed from two, to six, to ten mile rides, mostly to and from school. Soon the distance between school and home wasn’t clear or long enough so riding became a purposeful thing rather than utility. I rode and rode. By the end of the summer I had joined the half century club having ridden over fifty miles in one ride. In August I began running using the Couch to 5k program and ran my first full 5k on November 17 and putted along to finish my first 10k on December 15. As of today I have lost 178 pounds, wear a large and 34 jeans. I am stronger and faster than I’ve ever felt myself be. I feel appreciation and optimism in everything that I do and I sense that this is the way life should feel. I’ve still got a lot of work to do but at this point the habits have rooted and the education that I’ve gained over the last year will nurture them. I cannot see my life going backwards, this is who I was always supposed to be.


I’ve spent most of my life planning and daydreaming without action and now everything seems so attainable.This is why I write today, I’m ready to say goodbye to that old life now and to focus on maintaining goal oriented momentum and pushing harder so that the strength in my musings becomes the strength in my character. I can do better, I can do better. I can be the Greatest Man in the World.


Thank you to Mom, my Dad, Jerry, My brothers Eric and Adam, Jessica, Marshall, Corey, Colby; you guys specifically have given me clarity and always been frank with be about delicate things. And to Britt, Allen, Jen, Margie, and Alex, you guys give me the happiness I need to suck it up and do it. This might all seem overly sentimental but I only plan on doing this once and you’ve changed my life in ways that can’t really make sense to you.


Part of the audition process for the reality show I mentioned was to create a series of videos focusing on different aspects of my life. I edited one of them and am keeping a few private, but as for the rest, I don’t see a reason to keep it closeted anymore, I feel like that person is gone now. I uploaded these in May 2011, until now it has been accessible only to the producers of the show. For those interested, I have the links listed below. I think they are a thought-provoking relic.

758,"I would love to see manicures inspired by your favorite drink(s)! This could be nail art or just an overall color theme. Drinks can be soda, juice, tea, water, alcohol... anything liquid! I mean if you like to drink hair conditioner or something that's fine... I just don't think that's great for your health. :P Also you can do something that's related to your drink of choice... maybe mini-mugs on your nails if you love coffee or tea bags for you tea fanatics! Here's the rules I guess.

* Can be one hand (or foot). I'd prefer two but I'm not picky.
* Must have a time stamp in the picture with the date, time, your reddit name and the word ""refreshing"".
* Be creative and innovative!

This will end probably on January 31st at midnight EST. Unless no one participates. Then I will extend it forcing you to enter!!

Oh by the way... I'm thinking at least two winners. One by redditraffle and one picked by me. Who knows though.. I do still have giftcard money left!"

The criticism I've received from my mainline denominational higher-ups is ""Where's the good news in your sermon?"" I'm reading a preaching book right now with my senior pastor that raises some of these questions so I thought I'd blog about what preaching's primary purpose should be.

I think there are few words that feel as ugly and awkward as the word obese. Its the kind of word that always follows a sympathetic pause in the presence of the paunchy. It is so round and clinical and weighted down with taciturn lowness that it clings to a person in a way that squeezes and cripples him with what is simultaneously the most formidable and and the most elementary malady for a person to beat. January 5, marked one year since I resolved to change myself.This essay will probably be the most gushing and candid thing I’ve ever written, parts of this may seem attention seeking or boastful but I promise that this comes from the deepest, most sincere, and thought-worn parts of my heart. Its something I’ve had kicking around in my head for the better part of 15 years; this is the eulogy for my obesity.


Size has always dominated me, I began to chub around the fourth grade. I wouldn’t say that I was by any means a too-sad kid but I do think that feeling sad was a trigger for me. As a kid I had a difficult time finding a place where I felt like I was supposed to be. Whenever I would venture a try at something new, I would inevitably leave inadequate. I would feel bitter about being rejected by girls or I would feel sad about not being able to keep up with boys. In response I withdrew and went to food. As I grew up, I never felt right and I never I had anything that was mine with which to excel…I would fantasize about accomplishment and taking ownership of the kind of charisma and strength that would enamour me to those girls and make myself a hero in the minds of those guys, but I had lost so much ground over time that the idea of changing anything was daunting. It felt like my life was looming over me and I used food and humor as a means to swat it.


Gaining weight was mostly gradual with a few sharp spikes. It went on slowly until one day I realized that I was a fat kid and at once the idea got stuck in my head. I remember this feeling of compliance like:""well, this is me now."" As I grew older and boundaries widened, I became heavier. I would ride my bike to the Meijer on Clyde Park when it had a McDonalds in it and I would eat a Double Quarter meal Super-Sized and a twenty-piece chicken nuggets, turn around and ride home.

It didn’t help that I was also slow to develop socially; I didn't have friends yet and food became music for me. It entertained and occupied me. I would go to movies by myself (which I loved doing) I would devour my lonely popcorn and inhale my propitious Pepsi. With every little bit of freedom I enjoyed, my weight gain would apex and level off. When I got my first job (at a pizza joint) I had tons of free food and money to spend on whatever I liked, when I got my license I could travel farther for different brands and combinations of fast food.

763,"I recently started reading Sci-fi books and I'm loving them. I've read Hyperion, Forever War, and Old Mans War. My favorite parts about the books however are the variety of planets and alien life. Are there any books that stand out for vivid descriptions of numerous planets/aliens?"
764,"The Black Keys are often criticized for ""ripping"" off Led Zeppelin and Tom Petty in [Little Black Submarines](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F20zZKWeXyg), but people have criticized [Zeppelin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbnKzRvNTD8) for ripping off various [blues artists](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGIE28q3fEA).

So, what qualifies as an ""influence"" and what's a rip off? "

767,"Given that I'm only 21 years old and primarily an NBA fan (that said, I watch football every single Sunday, all of the playoff games, super bowl, etc. - I just follow basketball like a fanatic), forgive me if my pick seems to blatantly disregard some other amazing game!

For me, Super Bowl 42 was the most incredible game I've ever seen, and the most incredible moment with the Tyree catch. I also thought last year's Patriots vs. Giants rematch was surreal, and there was this weird aura surrounding that game leading into the game, and then after it. I honestly thought that destiny had brought the teams back together so that Brady could get revenge. In the NBA, I've always believed that there is a sort of justice to the game. The person who is supposed to win, will on day win when it's his time - IE, when he has been humbled or taught the harder lessons of losing in the first place. I almost classify Super Bowl 42 in with last year's super bowl for this reason - the games were so eerily reminiscent of each other, with the Manningham throw being a bit less impressive than the Tyree escape and catch, yeah, but still coming at a very similar time and place for the Giants, against the same opponent. 

For Brady, I figured that this chance to revenge the 2007 Super Bowl was going to be too tantalizing, too good for him to lose. It felt like he was supposed to win. That he didn't is, in my opinion, a testament to Eli Manning. I don't care how the Giants did this year - Eli has two championships against one of the greatest to ever do it. His ability to be there in the biggest moments, against some of the best players who *also* bring it in those moments, is remarkable.

**TLDR - Super Bowls 42 and 46 were my two favorite moments/games.**"

771,"hey guys. i've recently started composing, but i'm a bit overwhelmed by the possibilities. i know that i'm supposed to develop my own style, but i think that tips for composing is a worthy conversational topic.

so far what i've done is come up with an idea either in my head or on the piano, then sort of expanded on it. my ""best"" work so far is just a simple chord progression with a somewhat arbitrary melody.  how much do you mess with your ideas once you get them down on paper? how much do you somewhat just make up to fill in the spaces?

a personal question is regarding how to go about connecting two ideas smoothly. and i also know that practice is crucial, so what would you suggest doing as an exercise to develop compositional skill? would websites such as teoria be useful, or would it be better to work on my own?

anything else dealing with this kind of stuff i would love to hear. "

We've all been a part of it somehow, whether we were the ones being bullied, witnessed it, or were the bully yourself. (Although I sure hope not!)

774,"Hi i was wondering if people can help me with my assignment.

Assignment description:
You are a natural philosopher living in either Ancient Greece or Medieval Islam. Your colleagues and friends are philosophers like Plato and Aristotle, Al-Kindi and Averroes. You've decided to write an essay explaining why your society has produced so many outstanding achievements in natural philosophy. Using specific features of your society — its social structure, its culture, its attitude towards learning and the past, for instance — and specific examples to illustrate your position, write a powerful, detailed and persuasive essay linking your science and your society.

Your essay must include a clear and detailed statement – a thesis – that summarizes the argument you develop throughout the paper. The thesis should provide an answer to the question: ""How do the features of my society explain its achievements in natural philosophy?""
It must include specific examples to support your thesis. Think of how you might use specific achievements — ways of thinking about the natural world; specific theories about nature, or the body, for example — to illustrate your claims.


It's an introductory class to my science, technology and society course.

The maximum is about 750 words, and i don't know how to go about formulating something that the prof barely covered.

Any help would be great. Thanks"
775,"I am into noFap for 67 days now. It was a rough journey and it is still going. The reason, why I am writing this now is to motivate you guys!

I posted my ideas about the ""superpowers"" a few weeks ago, now I want to add a few things.

First of all: There are no superpowers. Just human powers and mindpower. The reason people think they are developing ""superpowers"" is, because their real abilities were hidden in numbness, shame, guilt and addiction symptoms. Once you can stop doing porn or/and masturbation, you regain those powers. 
Before noFap I had a fuzzy mind, quite good in debating though, but I made lots of mistakes.I did no sports (besides occasional running) and was not motivated to do anything usefull.
This is all gone by now. I am doing lots of sport, my mind is sharper than ever (at least if feels that way), I have tons of brilliant ideas and on and on. The best thing at all is, that my mind is calm.
Hard to describe with words, but everything seemes to be in order, no rushing or thought-circles. Beautiful and simple.

Today was specially interesting. I am dating this girl for a week now and we ended up in bed this day. After a while, she stops it (before sex) and says, she doesn't want to rush things. I said: Okay (I was surprised by that), no problem. I was horny at that point, but I was able to stop it with one single thought. She was really surprised, how I could do that. So I told her about noFap and she was really interested, even considered that she might have a slight problem.
I just loved it, how I was in charge of my mind and sexdrive all the time. She couldn't change it. I can get horny if I want to, but not if I don't.

Keep it up my friends, I made it and you can make it too.
I dislike Edison, so here is a quote from Nicola Tesla instead.

""Let the future tell the truth and evaluate ech one according to his work and accomplishments. The present is theirs;
the future, for which I really worked, is mine.""
"
776,"So here I am on my 90th day. I know it's not that big of a deal, but it's the longest I have gone without getting drunk since adolescence. Of course, I am nowhere near my goal, which is to get 500,000 days, but I am working on it. 

Was it hard? I really wish I could say that I struggled, that I'm a hero, and that it took the courage of five talking lions to get this far, but I would be lying. I think it's about perspective. I have the same temptations, urges, stressors as other people, but from my perspective, this has been nothing but a gift. The benefits of not being a lush have been so staggering that it out-reinforces every other competing interest. Focusing on the positive gifts, as opposed to the deprivation aspect has been critical. When confronted with even the notion of drinking, my automatic thought is, ""And give all this up? Are you nuts?"" In fact, on the topic of ""giving up"" things, I don't view myself as having ""given up"" anything; rather, I am for the first time in years actually giving myself a gift, and it's the best gift I have ever received. 

It should be noted that not drinking has not magically solved all of my problems. Far from it. It has, however, given me the ability to *see* my issues, and for once in my life, I actually have the *fucking time and energy* to work on them. 

Here are some ways my life has improved:

* **No more excuses.** Funny how when I was drinking, I told myself I never had the time to do things. These ""things"" ran the gamut from minute chores to major life tasks. I had any manner of excuses for not doing laundry, going to the gym, making my lunches for work, cleaning my place, staying on top of my finances, etc. Once I took a step back, I realized that I did have an excuse: I was a sot. I was too exhausted from my ""relaxation time"" to get anything done. I now have zero excuses, and those little things that add up to a normal life are all present, and I am actually living the way a grown man should, no excuses. 

* **Health**: Ever wonder what cutting out 80,000 calories of beer from your weekly consumption will do? I don't need to hypothesize, because I know. In conjunction, I no longer have an excuse not to work out, and I do so every day. Come to think on it, the positive benefits from exercising have by far been the biggest boon. Three months ago, I was barely fitting into my clothes (and I had very few clothes I could fit into at all). I looked like a pig swathed in tent canvas when dressed in my work clothes, and I was embarrassed to go out in my casual clothes, as I had so few that fit. I could *feel* the fat accumulating on me. Though I was not obese, I was a pure slob. A mere 90 days of hard work later, and this problem has completely evaporated (thanks /r/fitness FAQ). I dropped 15 pounds of fat and put on some muscle. Just last week, I had to go to the tailor to get some shirts and suits taken in. *Taken in*. Goddamn it does it ever feel good to look in the mirror and see myself getting leaner by the day. I still have a lot of work to do, but I love doing it, so it doesn't feel like a chore. 

* **Diet**. When I was drinking, I ate like an asshole. My hangovers and lack of energy led to my attitude toward eating to be along the lines of 'ME NEED FOOD NOW."" Obviously, I didn't have time to cook, because I was so busy ""unwinding"" and then recovering from my ""stress relief"". I ate out all the time, and of course, I needed to reward myself for being ""sick"" from my hangovers. All of that has changed. I cook every day, bring my lunches to work and am becoming a demon in the kitchen. Again, I've a long way to go before I'm an Iron Chef, but it feels awesome to be like, ""Yeah, I made that motherfuckers. Who wants to fucking touch me?""

* **Fucking time**. I had to use the eff word here, because this element is astounding. There are so many hours in a day, days in a week and weeks in a month (four). For years, I threw away so much of this time as if it was nothing. Every Saturday and Sunday morning, many weeknights, and most certainly weekend nights were boiled away with little positive residue left to show. It's no wonder I never got anything done! Since I changed, I find my time passes slower, like when I was a kid. This is not a bad thing. I have ample time to fulfill my obligations, and even more time to actually work on improving my life. This has caused me to be much more relaxed. 

* **Relaxation**. They say one's ability to react is proportional to their ability to relax. I never had relaxation time before. There was no time for me. My time was for work, and then for drinking. Sure, I deluded myself into thinking drinking with the boys was how I relaxed, but I wasn't. If anything, I was stressing myself out more by spending too much money, getting slobbier, ignoring my obligations, and pickling organs with booze. Now, I actively relax. When I play video games, it's because I've earned it. I book activities with friends and actually enjoy myself. I come home after a day of relaxing and feel tired, content and happy for the first time in a long while. 

* **Cash money**. How much does 80,000 calories of beer cost per week? A fucking lot. Combined with the lazy bought meals, idiotic splurges, and inattention to finances, boozing was having a drastic effect on the ol' billfold. I was most often a social drinker, which meant going out for beers. In my city, you're hard-pressed to get a beer for under eight bucks. My favorite way of managing my finances was to not look at all the random no-name ATM receipts I accumulated from different bars. Since I stopped, I meet all my obligations, no sweat. I also have money left over. I'm saving for the first time in my life. You know, like a fucking grown up.  

Anyways, I just wanted to share because then people would congratulate me and tell me what a good boy I am. "

778,"It is 10:30am in Miami, Florida.  It is time to set down your coffee, take a moment's pause, think, and decide on what the best thing you did for your fitness this week was: your fitness Victory.


Did you eat perfectly, hit all your macros and calorie goals, from a diversity of foods? Did you lift a huge huge weight? Did you run far, run fast, run often? Did follow your program to a T? Did you progress on all your lifts, or some of your lifts, or one of your lifts? Did you swim? **We want to hear about it.**

Here are last week's **Top five fitness Victories:** 

* **rule_27 (116 points)** 25 yo F, 125lbs.   Two weeks ago I posted about my 160lb. deadlift. Last week I hit 190, but I literally could not lift 195. This week, I pulled 205lbs. I thought I was crazy loading that weight onto the bar, expecting to lift it, but when I locked it out...and holy shit, I can now officially deadlift my boyfriend. 

* **AJCoastie (96 points)** I hit a body weight strict OHP at 180lbs on Tuesday; a goal that I've had for a year. On the same day I got a new squat PR at 350.

* **th0m (96 points)**  Had a baddass run of 15+ miles yesterday. I know this is mostly a weigh troom fitness thread and subreddit, but whatevs. Almost didn't go, but instead to the gym to lift even though today was a ""long run day"", but had one of those personal pep talks when getting dressed, the kind themed like, ""WTF are you doing you little shit, it's time for glory and you're surrendering before the battle even begins."" Actually enjoyed myself, too, found myself smiling numerous times, ran past a Wendy's and flipped it off just because I felt awesome and all those people in the drive through are just getting fat while I'm becoming a physical fucking specimen. Barked like a maniac at a dog that was behind a fence barking it's head off at me as I was running past. Encouraged an older runner who was wheezing and sweating hard despite the cold, because I'd have wanted that if I were struggling. Winked at a really cute girl running in the opposite direction (By the way, is it just me or are women just plain sexy in cold weather work out gear?).  Just took everything less serious and had a fantastic time and kicked my own ass. Had a PR for that route and felt like I could have gone another 5, easy.  Thank god for foam rollers. My calves/hammies/quads are in love. 

* **Novermars (71 points)** Touching my toes with my hands while sitting on floor with my knees straight. That just felt glorious. After so many years to be able to do that again. This kind of small succeses motivates me so much.

* **Bedhead03 (66 points)** Hit 200lbs body weight. I'll be outside having a beer with the other men.


**The ""You're Awesome"" Spotlight.**
 
This week, the spotlight shines on broken189 who, after 8 months of training toward it, finally achieved a one-armed pullup (actually: did it with his left, and then his right arm).  For setting and achieving a great long-term goal: **broken189, You're Awesome!**

HT to Zloty, impgas, and Baked_Otter for nominating broken189 for the spotlight. 

The ""You're Awesome"" spotlight is an occasional feature of Victory Sundays, wherein I select a deserving recipient to receive the eponymous adulation, in celebration of their previous Sunday's Victory. If you want to nominate someone for the ""You're Awesome"" spotlight, simply respond to their post with ""You're Awesome!""


And now it's your turn. **Let's hear your fitness Victory this week! Don't forget to upvote your favorite Victories!**

But still, I was expecting a more radical change in me by this time and it hasnt happened. All I got is a tight grip on a single thin thread of hope. I keep wondering when will I become a man of action and when will I really start putting myself out there (under-employed and virgin and never had gf) on a consistent basis. I dont know. I know change is slow and arduous process but for god's sake im 31 years old. Im just worried I'll be forever alone and forever a loser. Even so, I'll always keep hope alive.

805,"Is it important to take days off from running? Can I safely run twice a day (3-4 miles each time) without worrying about injuring myself (I don't bounce when I run, it's very low-impact)?
I started running the thursday before new years and have run every day since. I started running when I started reading Born to Run, which is about mexican/native american distance runners who run barefoot. MY question is, I've run everyday for a week and I'm getting a bit obsessive (because I have an obsessive personality) and I like it so much I want to do it in the morning and in the evening. I do a shuffling run that has little to no bounce or impact (like the Tarahumara) so I'm not too worried about impact injuries. My right groin is the only thing taking a beating.
I love the feeling of running and I'm getting really fit. I'm just worried that in this case my obsession will get me hurt or cause me to burn out. Thanks in advance for the guidance on this issue runnit!"
806,"My husband and I have been together for 11 years, married for 9. 

We've been through a lot together. I'm a manic depressive with social anxiety from an abusive childhood. He's a child of two alcoholics, grew up desperately poor and for the most part ignored. We met on the internet before it was a thing, fell in love when we weren't looking, and tore apart both our lives to be together. We are very, very good together. Everyone's always said we're that dream couple, the ideal, the proof that true love exists and can survive. 

For all the wonderful things we are, there is a lot of heartache. After many years of trying, we discovered we are unable to have biological children. A few years back, I hit a major depression- I stopped working, stopped leaving the house, almost stopped living. A year after I was back on my feet, our house burned down. We've had issues flinging our childhood abuse at one another, digging deep trenches between our hearts, and learning how much you can love and hate single person. Things are 'okay'. They just haven't been 'great' in a long time. 

Somewhere during my depression, I started smoking pot. I'd tried it when I was younger, but was never altogether impressed. After years of antidepressants making me feel like a zombie, and with two fathers in my life who both grow and smoke on a regular basis, I decided to give it a shot. Off the drugs and smoking on my own, I was able to learn my tolerance, my preferred methods, and how to medicate myself responsibly. The amazing world that opened up for me is nothing I have to explain to you all! 

Now, my husband has for a long time been straight edge. Native American, two addicts for parents- he just decided it was better not to partake of anything, ever. So good on him for that. And at the beginning of our relationship, he would have never put up with me smoking pot. But ten years and a best friend who's a daily smoker has softened his opinion. Gradually, it went from me smoking only when he wasn't home, to smoking in another room and sticking to myself, to smoking in another room and then joining him at the TV, to eventually smoking openly around him. 

Recently, he's been more and more brazen about getting contact highs when I smoke. Over Christmas we indulged in a holiday feast with his best friend(my dealer). Friend and I smoked beforehand, and it was very obvious my husband wasn't sober after a while. Now that I smoke in the living room, he opened up to admitting that he's getting high off my exhales. 

Now, he and I have always been in the habit of talking for hours on end about anything that comes up. It's one of the things we love most about our relationship. And of course, those conversations go over the top when I'm stoned. He dives in happily as I passionately rant about how professional wrestling is no different than chinese opera or roman arenas, or the subtle interconnectedness of everything we've ever thought and discussed over the years. 

But lately... things have taken a different tone. We've been married for a while now. Things haven't always been easy. We've shoved our baggage in each other's faces and left bruises. We've been through shit that would tear apart other marriages. We're in our mid thirties and wondering where we go next. And so lately, those stoned conversations spin back onto our marriage. 

We've been admitting things we've never admitted before. Fears and secrets, hopes and loves, anger, even hate. Last week while I was stoned and he was contact high-ing it with some help from Vicodin(for a back injury), we confessed both our intense dislike of certain parts of each other, our intense love for other parts, and our intense dedication to staying together. Beyond obligation or habit or fear, we admitted how utterly devoted we are to sharing our lives together. We've always been loving. We're very good at supporting one another. But this was different. This was more real, and more necessary than I'd ever realized. 

He tells me he likes me better when I smoke. He says it's great to see me momentarily free of my mental illness, and when I'm high, I'm the person he loves the most, the person he's stayed married to be with. 

I offered to smoke him out. He's accepted, at some point soon when he's feeling comfortable. For now he's pretty comfy getting high by proxy. I've even started exhaling in his direction. Whatever works,  man!

When we're high together, everything melts away, all the stress of life, any disagreements vanish. We're just two innocents in love again. And when we're sober, we share this secret wonderland that makes every smile a little more sparkly, ever hug or kiss linger a little longer. Our life is just more easy, and love rules every day. 

I just want to thank all of you for being here to teach me when I was learning, for showing all the different flavors and colours our beloved plant can impart, and in general being such excellent and admirable Hobbits. 

Happy Valentine's Day, y'all!

I think there are few words that feel as ugly and awkward as the word obese. Its the kind of word that always follows a sympathetic pause in the presence of the paunchy. It is so round and clinical and weighted down with taciturn lowness that it clings to a person in a way that squeezes and cripples him with what is simultaneously the most formidable and and the most elementary malady for a person to beat. January 5, marked one year since I resolved to change myself.This essay will probably be the most gushing and candid thing I’ve ever written, parts of this may seem attention seeking or boastful but I promise that this comes from the deepest, most sincere, and thought-worn parts of my heart. Its something I’ve had kicking around in my head for the better part of 15 years; this is the eulogy for my obesity.

Size has always dominated me, I began to chub around the fourth grade. I wouldn’t say that I was by any means a too-sad kid but I do think that feeling sad was a trigger for me. As a kid I had a difficult time finding a place where I felt like I was supposed to be. Whenever I would venture a try at something new, I would inevitably leave inadequate. I would feel bitter about being rejected by girls or I would feel sad about not being able to keep up with boys. In response I withdrew and went to food. As I grew up, I never felt right and I never I had anything that was mine with which to excel…I would fantasize about accomplishment and taking ownership of the kind of charisma and strength that would enamour me to those girls and make myself a hero in the minds of those guys, but I had lost so much ground over time that the idea of changing anything was daunting. It felt like my life was looming over me and I used food and humor as a means to swat it.

Gaining weight was mostly gradual with a few sharp spikes. It went on slowly until one day I realized that I was a fat kid and at once the idea got stuck in my head. I remember this feeling of compliance like:""well, this is me now."" As I grew older and boundaries widened, I became heavier. I would ride my bike to the Meijer on Clyde Park when it had a McDonalds in it and I would eat a Double Quarter meal Super-Sized and a twenty-piece chicken nuggets, turn around and ride home. This secret meal would lay on top of everything else I eaten during the day and I would enjoy it with stealth in my mind. It didn’t help that I was also slow to develop socially; I didn't have friends yet and food became music for me. It entertained and occupied me. I would go to movies by myself (which I loved doing) I would devour my lonely popcorn and inhale my propitious Pepsi. With every little bit of freedom I enjoyed, my weight gain would apex and level off. When I got my first job (at a pizza joint) I had tons of free food and money to spend on whatever I liked, when I got my license I could travel farther for different brands and combinations of fast food. Every bit of independance further cemented my habits.

Eventually I did develop a bit of a social lean but I still had a hard time accepting myself to my peers, I always felt like my stature stood between us. For example, one year we went to Michigan Adventure, I hadn’t thought much about the seat in a roller coaster and and never had a problem with a lap bar, but then I got in line for The Corkscrew. We waited eagerly and when the time came I walked up to the cart and looked inside and I thought ""shit."" I sat down next to a friend and it was tight but we were both able to sit. I reach up to pull down the shoulder harness and it wouldn’t click. My chest is too far from my back to get the harness to lock. I want to get out but instead an employee comes to me and tries to help by pressing it into me while I 'suck it in' No dice. I stood up and walked away with all the eyes on my back. I held the ride up and I was that fat kid that didn’t fit so I watched my friends ride the coaster from the sidewalk. It was the first time my size made me feel t isolated in front of someone. My attitude was to quietly tack roller coasters on to a list of things I couldn’t do. Eventually I out grew movie theater seats, airplane seats, and ‘Big & Tall’ sections in the mall and I passively waved goodbye to all of them.

And time just passed by - I built powerful, lasting, and comfortable relationships. I worked and had fun but never really achieved anything. I had quiet goals but all of the things I wanted for myself came to be plain conversational fodder, things you get drunk and dream about out loud. Everything I wanted was so public and everything I was was so private. I wanted to act and I wanted to be a comedian. I did open mics and it left me disgusted and exposed, it was a sort of exhilarating misery that kept you facing the goals you pushed away. I gradually lost momentum and just sort of stalled. Life for a few years was like a room dimly lit by the flickering light of a TV. It was quiet, and private, and comfortable. I remained stealthily obsessed with food. It occupied my mind. The flavors and textures and that feeling of occupation in your core gave me a sense of contentment that was so durable that it became ever-present in my life.

I haven’t always lacked a sense of the need for change. Periodically, I would have manic bouts of conviction and backbone. I would face the world and strive to be social, and better, and healthy. I would purse comedy again, I joined gyms, I sought and gained relationships...complacency though eventually had me back in my room eroding from a habit bordering agoraphobia. Eventually I realized that I wasn’t the possessor friends I once was and I became aware of the cheerlessness I felt for myself and that revealed to me the delicacy of the relationships I had. I was pushing people away from me so that I could revel in my faults. I began to see the folly and futility of so many of the years behind me. I became morbidly mindful of my mortality; I would imagine a roommate finding me dead and how they would react. How my family would react. In that, I realized that I’d lived so absent mindedly for so long that I had become OK with being dead when I was 40 and had subconsciously planned to be alone and idle for whatever time I had left. I’d let indulgence and apathy become intuitive.

A dramatic shift in my mindset came to pass around summer 2011. It was also around this time that I, as none of my friends or family knew, auditioned for a weight loss reality show. On the show, overweight men and women are taken away to a fitness sanctuary where they are taught healthy habits and exercise and exercise and exercise ... it was much like a real-life adult version of the movie Heavyweights. While gone, participants don’t communicate with family or friends and then, after an agonizing and heart lifting episode is complete, they are revealed to friends and family in a new body and attitude. I wanted to be a part of that show and thought I had it. I was interviewed and inline to be a part of the show when, abruptly, the series was put on hold and the new season never materialized.

I was devastated. I had poured my future into this idea that I could be taken away and fixed. That I was going to leave and come back as a new person for everyone to hold up cheer for. I had built up tremendous optimism and lost it all just as quickly. I went right back onto the destructive beat I had just left. Looking back, not making it on that show broke something for me and pushed me to get bad enough that I could get better.

Fortunately it only took about six months, I grieved the loss of my spotlight and my champion transformative moment and during that time reflected soulfully about who I am to the people in my life, who I am to myself, and most importantly recognized that I have it in myself to become the kind of person I want to be: I want to constantly be aware of my potential. I want to be a man that knows and practices right from wrong. I want to modestly inspire goodness, optimism, and effort in people; I want my integrity and my character to be something worth holding up. I want to be external and in the lives of people and I want people to feel that having me in their lives is a thing of value. In order to realize these things I had to accept accountability for what had misrepresented my capability and demeaned my resolve for so long. It wasn’t my weight, it was my attitude about life and an enduring lack of enthusiasm for the future.

I took responsibility for my well being one year ago, I weighed 420 pounds, I wore a XXXXXL dress shirt and 48 jeans. My life and the way I lived it literally changed overnight and hasn’t stumbled. I began by eating a calorie restricted diet and eventually shifted to focus on lower carbohydrates. For exercise I started by walking three miles a day. I would take the bus to school, get off walk a ways and get back on further down the route. Once spring rolled around I began to bike. Those rides progressed from two, to six, to ten mile rides, mostly to and from school. Soon the distance between school and home wasn’t clear or long enough so riding became a purposeful thing rather than utility. I rode and rode. By the end of the summer I had joined the half century club having ridden over fifty miles in one ride. In August I began running using the Couch to 5k program and ran my first full 5k on November 17 and putted along to finish my first 10k on December 15. As of today I have lost 178 pounds, wear a large and 34 jeans. I am stronger and faster than I’ve ever felt myself be. I feel appreciation and optimism in everything that I do and I sense that this is the way life should feel. I’ve still got a lot of work to do but at this point the habits have rooted and the education that I’ve gained over the last year will nurture them. I cannot see my life going backwards, this is who I was always supposed to be.

I’ve spent most of my life planning and daydreaming without action and now everything seems so attainable.This is why I write today, I’m ready to say goodbye to that old life now and to focus on maintaining goal oriented momentum and pushing harder so that the strength in my musings becomes the strength in my character. I can do better, I can do better. I can be the Greatest Man in the World.

Thank you to Mom, my Dad, Jerry, My brothers Eric and Adam, Jessica, Marshall, Corey, Colby; you guys specifically have given me clarity and always been frank with be about delicate things. And to Britt, Allen, Jen, Margie, and Alex, you guys give me the happiness I need to suck it up and do it. This might all seem overly sentimental but I only plan on doing this once and you’ve changed my life in ways that can’t really make sense to you.

Part of the audition process for the reality show I mentioned was to create a series of videos focusing on different aspects of my life. I edited one of them and am keeping a few private, but as for the rest, I don’t see a reason to keep it closeted anymore, I feel like that person is gone now. I uploaded these in May 2011, until now it has been accessible only to the producers of the show. For those interested, I have the links listed below. I think they are a thought-provoking relic.

Think about it, it makes perfect sense. The acrobatics can be easily attributed to Raiden. Maybe it's a stupid idea, but maybe some will accept it and move on from hating this game so much.

* Edit - It was also mentioned that Raiden went through a VR simulator of Shadow Moses, so considering The Twin Snakes Raiden in a VR mission isn't too far-fetched."

My husband thinks it's cool and I just got it cut and colored, so I was feeling way better. I even put on a little makeup and felt cool and pretty.

Then my mom saw a pic on social media and texted me saying...don't try to be so butchy...your look could be so feminine...put on some hoop earrings and high heels...etc.

Who cares if I look butch!? Butch women are strong and cool and smart and all the other things that feminine women are. I don't have to listen to her negative talk, but it sure is horrible how fast my self-confidence tanks after one comment. I'm too well trained. "

841,I'm looking for some good sci-fi books to read and I would like to read something which is in the same spirit as Star Trek - but is not a Star Trek book. It might be a bit ambiguous but what I'm searching for is basically a good read which shows the best side of humanity (or some other race). I'm a bit fed up with cyberpunk and dystopias an so on. What I really like about the Star Trek series is the positive vibe and the hope for a better future and it would be nice to read some books which reflects these values. I think you get the point :)

I think there are few words that feel as ugly and awkward as the word obese. Its the kind of word that always follows a sympathetic pause in the presence of the paunchy. It is so round and clinical and weighted down with taciturn lowness that it clings to a person in a way that squeezes and cripples him with what is simultaneously the most formidable and and the most elementary malady for a person to beat. January 5, marked one year since I resolved to change myself.This essay will probably be the most gushing and candid thing I’ve ever written, parts of this may seem attention seeking or boastful but I promise that this comes from the deepest, most sincere, and thought-worn parts of my heart. Its something I’ve had kicking around in my head for the better part of 15 years; this is the eulogy for my obesity.


Size has always dominated me, I began to chub around the fourth grade. I wouldn’t say that I was by any means a too-sad kid but I do think that feeling sad was a trigger for me. As a kid I had a difficult time finding a place where I felt like I was supposed to be. Whenever I would venture a try at something new, I would inevitably leave inadequate. I would feel bitter about being rejected by girls or I would feel sad about not being able to keep up with boys. In response I withdrew and went to food. As I grew up, I never felt right and I never I had anything that was mine with which to excel…I would fantasize about accomplishment and taking ownership of the kind of charisma and strength that would enamour me to those girls and make myself a hero in the minds of those guys, but I had lost so much ground over time that the idea of changing anything was daunting. It felt like my life was looming over me and I used food and humor as a means to swat it.


Gaining weight was mostly gradual with a few sharp spikes. It went on slowly until one day I realized that I was a fat kid and at once the idea got stuck in my head. I remember this feeling of compliance like:""well, this is me now."" As I grew older and boundaries widened, I became heavier. I would ride my bike to the Meijer on Clyde Park when it had a McDonalds in it and I would eat a Double Quarter meal Super-Sized and a twenty-piece chicken nuggets, turn around and ride home. This secret meal would lay on top of everything else I eaten during the day and I would enjoy it with stealth in my mind. It didn’t help that I was also slow to develop socially; I didn't have friends yet and food became music for me. It entertained and occupied me. I would go to movies by myself (which I loved doing) I would devour my lonely popcorn and inhale my propitious Pepsi. With every little bit of freedom I enjoyed, my weight gain would apex and level off. When I got my first job (at a pizza joint) I had tons of free food and money to spend on whatever I liked, when I got my license I could travel farther for different brands and combinations of fast food. Every bit of independance further cemented my habits.


Eventually I did develop a bit of a social lean but I still had a hard time accepting myself to my peers, I always felt like my stature stood between us. For example, one year we went to Michigan Adventure, I hadn’t thought much about the seat in a roller coaster and and never had a problem with a lap bar, but then I got in line for The Corkscrew. We waited eagerly and when the time came I walked up to the cart and looked inside and I thought ""shit."" I sat down next to a friend and it was tight but we were both able to sit. I reach up to pull down the shoulder harness and it wouldn’t click. My chest is too far from my back to get the harness to lock. I want to get out but instead an employee comes to me and tries to help by pressing it into me while I 'suck it in' No dice. I stood up and walked away with all the eyes on my back. I held the ride up and I was that fat kid that didn’t fit so I watched my friends ride the coaster from the sidewalk. It was the first time my size made me feel t isolated in front of someone. My attitude was to quietly tack roller coasters on to a list of things I couldn’t do. Eventually I out grew movie theater seats, airplane seats, and ‘Big & Tall’ sections in the mall and I passively waved goodbye to all of them.


And time just passed by - I built powerful, lasting, and comfortable relationships. I worked and had fun but never really achieved anything. I had quiet goals but all of the things I wanted for myself came to be plain conversational fodder, things you get drunk and dream about out loud. Everything I wanted was so public and everything I was was so private. I wanted to act and I wanted to be a comedian. I did open mics and it left me disgusted and exposed, it was a sort of exhilarating misery that kept you facing the goals you pushed away. I gradually lost momentum and just sort of stalled. Life for a few years was like a room dimly lit by the flickering light of a TV. It was quiet, and private, and comfortable. I remained stealthily obsessed with food. It occupied my mind. The flavors and textures and that feeling of occupation in your core gave me a sense of contentment that was so durable that it became ever-present in my life.


I haven’t always lacked a sense of the need for change. Periodically, I would have manic bouts of conviction and backbone. I would face the world and strive to be social, and better, and healthy.

850,"TL;DR: Zooks is gay, Tilt and I have sex and it bothers Zooks because he's lonely. Lots of tension ensued, song ""I belong to you"" by lenny kravits helped bring the 3 of us together again and almost made me cry because the song fits so perfectly with tulpamancy and our relationship.

Tilt, Zooks and I have been going through some very hard times lately. About 2 weeks ago, Tilt and I... had relations. I never wanted it but he did and it just.. happened. Awkward I know. Gadzooks admited to me he was gay a few days before (which is totaly fine). When Tilt and I started our sex life, it really botherd him. he didn't have anyone because tilt is technicaly his brother and it made things wierd. Things got heated and it eventualy cooled down a bit when I told him I would work on a third tulpa who would be a partner for him( because I was thinking of it anyway) ... now it has been a little while and I havn't even started with this third tulpa and he was really upset. ALONG WITH ALL THIS was the fact that i have not been forcing even a fraction as much as I should. I do quick trips to the wonderland to give tilt+zooks a quick pat and talk to them but no acive forcing. they have been suffering but understanding and are amazing for dealing with me but this added tons of strain to the problems. today I said something kinda mean that zooks heard, I didn't mean it intentionaly it was just kind of a passing thought but it set off all of the stuff that has been going on. Zooks went off to his separation spot and I went there and he tried to block me by creating a portal that kept sending me back to the wonderland (like the lost woods in zelda) eventualy i just forced myself to where he was and picked him up and carried him back to the wonderland. I explained I didn't mean to hurt him and apologized for all that had been going on and then we started talking. Tilt came along at this point and layed next to us in the field of tulips where we where. I wanted them to understand how I felt about them so I played ""I belong to you"" By lenny kravits. [PLEASE READ THE LYRICS!!!](http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/l/lenny_kravitz/i_belong_to_you.html) We started singing and the connection was just so amazing.. the song expressed our relationship and feelings so perfectly I was blown away...I almost cried I was so happy... and if you read the lyrics IT FITS SO PERFECTLY WITH TULPAMANCY IT""S CREEPY"

854,"My school has a writing club that I've never been to. I've been seriously writing as a hobby, but I can't bring myself to walk into that door and introduce myself. 

What do I even say. ""Hey I write on Reddit!""

I think I'm decent, but I prefer the anonymity that the internet brings. I know there's no problem with this, but currently my girlfriend is urging me to at least give it a try. I'm just afraid of my serious writings being ridiculed. I know they'll only offer help there, but I'm showing them my heart. I'm pretty protective of it. 

Does anyone else have any experience like this? I'm sure this is a clear cut, go if I want to go and don't go if I don't want to. But I was wondering if anyone had any pros or cons of meeting other writers in person versus ones who are behind a screen somewhere. "

Like the title says, Ive been using Live for about 10 months now and am at the point where I need to expand tonally and break out of just using the Live instruments and effects (powerful as they are...). I have Suite, so have all the instruments, and I also have a copy of MASSIVE that i havent really used for much more than sub-bass (I know its incredibly powerful and definitely plan to get into it soon).

I really have no idea where to start. What do I even need? I make electronic type music. Hiphop, reggae, and pretty much anything else with lots of bass and good rhythms. Some effects plug ins would be great. Compressors, delays, etc...

Also, if anyone has any advice on mixing songs, please let me know! This is also part of the reason why my tracks thus far are suffering tonally and sounding flat. I know enough to bounce everything out from MIDI to WAV and then mix further from there, but am at a loss for ways to make a heavy sub bass without blowing up the entire song or having my synths sound bright and powerful but not cheesy.

Not to mention depression is much less likely.  You are now an alpha male not because you are superior, but because you have control over your own mind in this addiction.  And that’s a super power.  Because if you can do it, that means you can lead others in that direction as well...a very alpha trait.

I encourage all of you to keep telling stories that reflect your newfound power.  These stories helped me to make this decision 263 days ago.  And I am very grateful.

890,"**TL;DR:  what would you do with this yard in its first year when you have virtually no tools or experience with garden planning, on a budget.** 


[Here is an aerial view of my new yard.](http://imgur.com/H7o4S)  

It's 70 feet wide and 210-250 feet deep.  The back yard has southern exposure, and the front of the house faces north.  I know I don't want to fuss too much with annuals, and that I want a large vegetable garden.  I canned about 250 lbs of produce last year.  I will probably keep the veggie garden simple with lots of tomatoes, cucumbers, zucchini, radishes, green onions, and maybe a pumpkin plant.  I have experience growing these, so that's not too worrisome,  but where to put it?!

My question is, where do I start?  Where should my vegetable garden be?  Should I do raised beds with stone surrounding, or is just a big patch of tilled dirt okay?  Is there anything I can do along the property lines to make it look less barren (and make for less grass to cut!)?  I got some great advice in [this post about the front garden,](http://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/comments/1682vw/i_want_to_plant_a_flowering_perennial_garden_this) but now my confidence is about zero and I'm nervous that I'm going to make some expensive mistakes.  I'm hoping to keep my expenditures under $500 a year, but this year that will include gloves, trowels, rakes, watering cans, stakes, topsoil, tilling, and the like, so it will probably be closer to $1,000 when all is said and done.    

I'm realizing that this question is super broad.  Maybe I just need some encouragement.  My SO doesn't care what I do as long as it involves adding a shade tree each year (we have no trees at all on the property), so I'm going at it alone and it's overwhelming.

Edit to add that the soil looks very similar to what I grew up with a little further south.  Very dark rich brown, not clay and not sand.  We're close to the river so there will be some stones to pick but otherwise it looks pretty damned good.

895,"Been reading gainit for a while and thought I might ask some advice from this awesome subreddit!

I will give you a brief background. I used to be [VERY VERY skinny](http://i.imgur.com/0UOKRVe.jpg) when I was younger, at 18 i weighed about **99lb!** I started doing strength based training and after about 4 years im now at 141lb. To be fair I'm only 5'6. When i first started I was on creatine and fuckloads of protein and i made mad progress in the first three months. I have since being training on and off.

I want to move onto some more hypertrophy based routine but im not sure if my strength level is high enough. I am on the second week of my first cycle doing 5/3/1 BBB using the [strstd](http://www.strstd.com) site to work out my 1rm. Here are my stats: 

Age: 22 Height: 5'6 Weight: 64kg (141lb) Bench 187lbs, Squat 182lbs, DL 229lbs, OHP 118lb. [Here are the relevant pictures.](http://imgur.com/a/gso4C)

915,"After some arm-chair philosophizing, I elect the following runners-up in cognizance:

**Elephants**. Bury their dead (in a manner of speaking), can identify different African tribes based on colors of clothes and smell, both significant signs of intelligence. 

*Problems*: males can be overly aggressive; long life-spans make selective breeding and/or assisted evolution take a lot longer.

**Octopus**. Can learn through observation (that's a huge deal), are insanely fast at learning puzzles and mazes, many anecdotes exist about their clever antics in aquariums like sneaking out of their tanks at night to feed in other fish tanks, returning to their own tank afterwards. 

*Problems*: Die when they breed (hormonal thing, both the male and female will starve themselves to death after procreation), so parents could never assist in teaching their young. 

**Dolphins**. Known for ages to be incredibly intelligent, Capable of creativity (when trainers gave two dolphins a unique command they had never heard before that moment, them swam under water, chatted a bit, resurfaced and both did a synchronized trick never performed before).

 *Problems*: So Gay. j/k. I don't know much about dolphins.

**Pigs**: Saw a recent study where they learned to play basic video games. Says a lot about intelligence, understanding that ""if I move this joystick, that little thing over there moves""; I dunno how well they understood the game's objective, but still... dudes.  Imagine playing MarioKart with a species of highly intelligent pygmy oinkers. (Pygmies, so they won't use so many resources, and adapt easier to our current infrastructure). 

*Problems*: No more pig meat for anyone, it would seem like eating babies. Also no fine digits, they can't really make anything for themselves. Dolphins are in the same boat. Elephants have a similar problem, except they seem to be able to use their trunks for a lot. Octopus have been shown to make basic tools, like armor out of coconuts to protect themselves.

**Sea Lions** Recently came upon [this article](http://discovermagazine.com/1993/feb/riothelogicalsea184#.UQ2dQPJnQXg) which shows that at least one sea lion is capable of some very advanced logical thinking. 

*problems* the same problems with any long-living animal. Also the same problem with giving sentience to any sea-life: can't really go dumping everything in the ocean anymore, which is where we dump most of our stuff. "

917,"I read a book lately: Ready Player One by Ernest Cline. Gaming Sci-fi. Fun and lighthearted. It tells the story of a boy who plays a game every moment of his life because it gives him hope.

Until the end, I didn't understand that I, too was living in a simulation.

My simulation encompasses nearly every living moment. It's Magic: The Gathering. It's books. It's TV. It's YouTube. It's this fucking site right here that I spend hours glued to.

My simulation is tailored perfectly to my interests. It's a bubble of satisfaction and distraction. It's a place where I can solve immense problems creatively and hear moving, deeply human stories. In my simulation, life is easy and there are so many good things to do.

But in the real world I have grown weak. I've become recalcitrant to discipline, and even the most menial tasks-- organizing my binders for classes, for example-- are postponed for days. I'm more socially awkward now than I was in high school. I've been in college for several months now, and I haven't even gotten a girl's number. I can't face myself in the mirror. I can't live like this anymore. 

As long as I use media to escape my problems, I will be dead inside.

When I look away from my phone and computer and out of my window, I remember my dreams. I want to be a distance runner and a biologist and a lover and a father and everyone's favorite goofy drunk. I want faces, not usernames. I want hugs, not that fucking Reddit Gold crap.

My soon to be bandmates would like to head for something along the lines of DnB incorporating elements from jazz blues and funk, our main issue is that we haven't really heard much of this style and are trying to find a few examples of it to see who and what inspires us most. Our aim is to take DnB from the studio and gear it towards a live band setup similar to pendulum, modestep, and loadstar... but with more of a relaxed fusion feel.

Essentially my question is, are there any bands, groups, or artists you know of that incorporate the styles together well, if so could you recommend some? As creating a band involving DnB in any way is something that I've wanted to do for a long time and /r/DnB have always had some great recommendations in the past.

This loss hurts me, but my faith is my solace. I hope you take a moment to pray for him, even if you're not a Muslim. Thank you."

941,"Why do we fall?

90 days ago I started this journey, I started this journey more then often and always failing at some point, resetting the badge time after time.

Now I finally can say I did it, although this is not an end, its just the start to a new way of life.

I found like so many of you awesome people, that the first half is the toughest.
I thought that this calm state of mind would never come but somewhere around day 45 the calmness set in and it realy was quite and easy journey from then on.
The crazy cravings, the blue balls and your mind telling you 'ah just 1 fap' all off that will go away and you can feel your strong brain, the real you, getting its power back and simply saying; No.

One thing I read when I started was all the 'superpowers' people gained.
Everyone is different, but I dont feel that different from before. 
There are some big changes but I dont see that as some massive superpower.

The biggest change there is;
Girls

They are everywhere!

One of the best posts I read from one of you guys said:
'its not that they started to notice you, its that you start noticing them'

This is true in every way, I never was a shy guy when it came to talking to girls but Im no cassanova. I would never flirt with a girl and would not know when one was flirting with me!

Maybe this is the only superpower Ive gained, picking up and sending out signals to girls.
Im 24 and in the last 6 years before nofap, I've slept with 3 girls...

During my short nofap period I talked to more strange girls then I ever did before, ended up with more new phone numbers then in all those years and ended up waking up next to a beautiful woman 2 times!
Both of them confident, fun and older then me, 4 and 8 years older.

I have no issues with age differences, I think its how you 'click' with each other that matters and not the age, but I think it does show that these confident woman found me attractive, something like that just didnt happen before nofap.

Something else happend, a (girl) friend of mine said to me after having a nice long talk with her; 'everytime I see you I get all fuzzy and warm inside' and made some obvious remarks she was into me. She is in a long term relationship with some guy and although Im not into her it sort of felt good to hear that.
Another experience that has never happend before nofap to me...

Besides the magnificent things that are called girls, I think the best thing is just the calmness in my mind.
No crazy porn thoughts, no shame after that one last fap and no need to clear your internet surf history!

I read that a lot of guys get super into new sports and hobbies and stuff like that.
I like just to continue living like I did, sure I picked up my guitar more and started exercising more, but thats a logical cause of nofap. 
Youve got to keep yourself busy and your mind away from that computer.
Once you get bored and youve got nothing to do, thats when the urges come.

So no fantastic new hobby, no massive abs and strong musscles, no meditation and zen master for me.
Just enjoying life like before, with a beer and my ps3 but now knowing there is a smoking hot chick waiting for me in the other room ;)

Good luck my interweb friends, just know it does get better.

Why do we fall?
To get back up again.

948,"This might seem like a weird question, but I'm really curious to know. I'm a mid 20's female who has struggled with a lot of depression, anxiety, and destructive thought patterns. I've self-medicated in ways healthy and unhealthy, but I have to say that illicit opiate use, when I manage it very carefully, has done me some good. The clarity and calm I can get through opiates has gotten me out of awful spirals of self-reinforcing negative thoughts, and often one or two uses a month has been beneficial.

But, I hate the illegal/shady aspects. That's why I am interested in kratom, and curious if it can have the same affects. I have heard that it is very subtle...does that mean if I take it when I am depressed (when I would most need something to pull me out of my funk) that it won't have the same effects? Can it penetrate when the darkness is incredibly overbearing?

I would really appreciate some input."

I did it all while having surgery on my foot that has put me out of commission for about three months now, (four big ass screws, a bone removed etc) breaking both feet,  fracturing my right hand and collar bone, getting a concussion, and tearing the cartilage in my left shoulder.  

If you'd told me that i would be this driven and dedicated at the beginning of last year, it would have seemed pretty crazy, and if you'd told me that it was a game that gave me that kind if drive, I'd probably have laughed at you,  because honestly, it seems pretty damn ridiculous, but it's worked, and I know I'm not alone in this.

Because I am part of a Subaru family already (2005 Blouch 16g WRX wagon for me, XV crosstrek for my wife, Outback for my father-in-law), it seems traitorous to want the Evo.  However, the Evo takes so much less effort to make that kind of power reliably. Also, I am in love with that twin clutch SST (wife refuses to drive manual) and sitting in those Recaro seats is otherworldly.

> In actual play, your character should be motivated to act, and to
act as part of a group. Te game does not deal well with hostile
loners, apathetic brooders, or other characters that have to be
coaxed into engaging with the world and cooperating with the rest
of the group. The world of Stars Without Number is dangerous, and a character that cringes from peril or insists on facing it alone will find only boredom or an early grave.

Obviously there's a place for inter-party conflict in some games of D&D, but generally speaking, cooperation is almost always the optimal choice.

It took time, but it was worth it. I can't even begin to explain what kind of opportunities this has brought me. It is an extreme life changing event, and I want everybody to know how it feels!

What would it look like? Would there be one body, or many? Stationary or moving? Is there any sci fi literature that goes beyond ""let's make them like humans""?

And a second, closely related question: would such an AI try to make an ""offspring,"" making something with a slightly different program, or would it simply create many bodies for itself to inhabit?

I know this is speculation, but I'm sure there are plenty of good ideas out there."

So that's me at my heaviest...165 pounds at 5'3"". I was constantly indulging and over-eating/snacking and then killing myself at the gym about three times a week. I was getting nowhere. 
I stayed at this weight until July of 2012. I went on a vacation with some girl friends and realized I was the biggest one. I knew I had to get my act together. I started a super low-carb lifestyle, and ate about 1,200 calories a day. I also started a morning routine that began with 20x3 pushups, 45secx3 planks, and 30 squats. Then I would run 3 miles at least 3 or 4 times a week. I ended up increasing my morning routine over time, and now I do 25 squats; 50 pushups, 1 min plank; 40 pushups, 1 min plank; 30 pushups, 1 min plank; 25 squats. I did (and still do this) since late July 2012, and yesterday I took this photo of myself in my dream bikini, which I will be wearing in a few days when I arrive in Brazil for my semester abroad!

1051,"This is one aspect of a large and huge Independent Reading assignment given out by my AP English teacher. My friend decided to choose Aldous Huxley's Doors of Perception as our reading. I, having no idea what it was about, stupidly agreed, 

Fast forward a month later, I wind up reading the composition and get started on my end of this project. [Here it is](http://imgur.com/a/Mzu9G). I slowly toil away at creating an in depth account of Huxley's own recordings during his mescaline trip, and of his thoughts and expectations regarding said trip prior and after the experience. 

I get stuck on finding a second assignment on the aforementioned sheet to do, being that assignments 4 and 6 are claimed by my partner. I tried to do the poetry assignment (9) regarding connecting the composition to a modern and ancient poem, but I am having tremendous difficulty in finding something old to connect to Huxley's writings about (what I believe to be) existentialism at all. The guy who he quoted the title of his piece from dropped the line in an essay, not a poem. I am pretty stuck right now, and would appreciate help on this matter at hand.

If you guys feel that the second assignment I chose is not really compatible with Doors of Perception, I am happy to do another assignment from my linked list, just please give me a nudge in the right direction!

Thank you for taking your time to read this! I'm really desperate for some help on this!

I understand that those who seek to ban faith-based presentations should not be so hypocritical as to allow a Christian one, but if anyone, including an atheist, tries to oppose a Christian presentation on public property then we are just as bad as those people in Oklahoma.

My main point is that any reasonable presentation, faith-based or not, should be embraced.

This was earlier today, and it looks like everyone had a good time, while i've just laid in bed all day being sad.

1068,"So, a small conversation with /u/hmwith convinced me to go out and get my breasts refitted. I'd seen the MyWifeBusty guide so many times, but since I'd been convinced that I was wearing the right size, I never bothered measuring myself. Well, I finally did, and realized that I was several cup sizes off, and it was time to get at least one new bra. Last weekend, I made a trip to Nordstrom with my mother. 

Shopping with my mother is never fun. 

This rant isn't about my experience at Nordstrom. It was fantastic there. I was blown away at their size selection. Never before had I gone bra shopping, and seen sizes that went above an E. The attendant was wonderful, fitted me perfectly (to a 34HH), showed me why my old bra (a 34DDD) did not work for me, and I left the store with [this lovely bra](http://www.panache-lingerie.com/superbra-by-panache/collection/21540681/Full-Cup-Bra). I'm still amazed. I've never worn a bra that fit like this before and gave me so much support. 

So my trip to Nordstrom was a success. It's my mother I'm ranting about. She's always angry that I can't fit into ""cute"" clothes because my boobs won't fit properly in there, and the entire shopping trip always turns into a tirade of ""Disgruntled_Badger, you know if you lost weight, you'd be prettier and be able to wear prettier clothes. This doesn't fit either? Your boobs are too big. I'd love to get these clothes for you if you fit in them. Oh well.""

It's always sucked. I've always been self conscious about my breasts because of it. I wore baggy clothes trying to hide them, and began to slouch because it would cover them better. I've dealt with this my entire life, and I stopped doing my shopping with her. And recently, *out of the blue* she began to tell me that I looked good just the way I was. This freaked me out. I've never heard this from her before in my entire life. But you know what, it felt *good*, finally being validated by my own mother. I was happy. 

So this entire time, my mother thought I was a 34DDD. And I guess that was fine to her. My breasts looked good. I looked good. And *suddenly*, as soon as I'm fit properly, and I explain to her that I need a 34HH bra, she's pissed.

My breasts look good, but as soon as you stick a two-digit number and a letter on them, they're outrageous. Suddenly, they're not fine anymore. Suddenly, they've turned into these monstrous, 50 pound boobs. I mean, excuse me. They are the *same* exact boobs that you were telling me looked good. They have a different letter on them, and now you've changed your mind? Now they're too big, *again?*

As we were leaving, I tried to reason with her. I told her, ""Mom, I don't think I'm that fat. But if these are the way my breasts are, and if they're just this large, then what am I supposed to do about it?""

I want you guys to know that this was the first time I've ever said aloud ""I'm not that fat"". All these years, she'd drilled into my head that big boobs = fat. I know better now. I know it's different with each person. 

But she turned to me, and said, ""You think you're not fat? I want you to look at yourself sometime, and say that again.""

While we walked to the car, she went on, asking me what my problem was. Didn't I want to wear cute bras and clothes? Did I really want to be stuck wearing ""ugly, old-people bras"" for my entire life? Why do I do this to myself? Why do I do this to her? 

At that point, I told her to please stop talking. I didn't want to hear it. I was too upset, and I wasn't in the mood to keep listening to her through the car ride home. We went bra shopping three days ago. She's indeed stopped talking, and hasn't talked to me since then. She's limited our conversations to ""Welcome back home, how was school, do you want dinner?"" *She's* mad at *me*, though I can't think of what I'd done wrong, aside from being big-boobed.  I've already gone back to trying to talk to her normally, but she's still distant. I'm not apologizing, because I hadn't said anything to her. 

Anyway. Sorry, girls. I just needed to get that off my chest. I'm still upset about everything. The whole bra shopping experience was ruined because of my mother's interference, and her cattiness has made the past three days difficult. I talk to my older brother about everything, but I know that his sister's boobs are a subject he cares little for.

tl;dr: Bra shopping was a success; realized how important the alphabet is to my mom.

Dont worry - if you do feel like the guy is a loser or any such thing - just be honest! It would help me - and certainly other big people know how to react (or how to strengthen the mind) before running

Thanks guys for your opinions (and honesty!)

1082,"Hello Ketopians! Just a quick announcement from your r/keto mods!

***Please upvote for visibility. This is a self post and receives no karma.***

We’ve recently been discussing the future direction of this community and have found that many of the science-based posts and other relevant discussions are buried under an endless list of progress pictures and food porn. We love all of your amazing weight loss stories and to see the results of this lifestyle change on so many different people is truly inspiring. We also believe that this community is a place to help people succeed with Keto. That being said, in order to improve the overall quality of the community, we’ve discussed and put into action the idea of making /r/keto “Self-Post/Text Post Only”. What this means is that for most posts, nothing changes. What does this change?

_________________________
**Progress Pictures:** We'd love for you to create a writeup that lets people know about your specific keto experience; where you started, how long it's taken you, struggles you've had along the way, how you've overcome them, some of your favorite recipes, tips for beginners, where you'd eventually like to end up, your plans to get there, etc. And with this write-up, post links to your progress photos.

**FoodPorn:** Same deal. We want to know how you made whatever it is you’re eating! Post a recipe or even a simple process if it’s just something you threw together in the kitchen. If it’s a really well thought out recipe or an external link, you might want to think about posting it to r/ketorecipes.

**Scale Pictures:** Please don’t. It’s really exciting to look down and see a number you haven’t seen in a long time (or have never seen) and to know that you’re making progress, but to the rest of the community... it’s simply numbers and toes on a scale. Instead, create a full blown progress post! How did you get down to 299lbs, 99kg, or 20 stone?? Take photos of yourself along the way, or even just before and afters!

_________________________

We really think this small change will result in an overall boost in quality posts on /r/keto. We want to encourage more content and detailed information along with your posts of infographics, progress pics and crazy food porn. What we hope is that this small change will improve the overall quality of the content you read in the community and give some of the more important discussions the ability to reach our front page, and thus a wider audience.

Martinus and LadySixString have been working tirelessly to get our [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq) updated and ported over to the new Reddit format and we’ve got some great info in the [sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/about/sidebar) and [Keto In A Nutshell](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gZfJejOM8fJsX1iCilmnpp1qmT_KncJwWCR4-EsaEHc/edit?pli=1) that tend to answer 98% of the questions you’ll have regarding Keto. Read through everything and still have a question? Either enter a keyword in the keto search bar or create a post! There are literally thousands of people who have been exactly where you are that can answer just about any question you throw at them.

Thank you all for being a part of this amazing community! We can’t wait to see what 2013 brings!

          - Your friendly neighborhood r/keto Mods"

1134,"Trying to get a taste of downhill after being a fan for a long time, I've been riding xc for about 6 months and want to give downhill a fair try

The problem is I really don't know where to go, I'm in the south east and not too far from Aston hill but even the easiest trails there are too much for me, they're full of roots and rocks without really giving me a chance to gain any speed and get comfortable with it.

Basically what I'm asking is, does anybody know of a downhill trail in south east UK that would be good for a beginner to get comfortable with speed and small jumps 

If anybody has been to Aston Hill, is it just that the beginner trail is evil and I should go for the next one up?

Edit: First time I went, I had a full face helmet and nothing else, I now have some cheap body armour and kneepads so maybe that would help with the lack of confidence"

1138,"So, clearly people are already complaining about the newest CEMU build (patreon build mind you).
And their complaints are often real issues, not just nit picks. But why would they target Exzap? Well this is the point in the emulators life where between each update, the progress is not insane or amazing. And this is not helped by the fact that previously we'd receive updates as close together as a week or two. But Exzap cannot avoid this part of an emulators life cycle. Anyway, I think that people want to blame Exzap, because he is the face of the CEMU team. He's the one who you can blame it on. It's like when a mom steadily gives her kids $20 every week as an allowance, but when she falls on hard times it's reduced to $5. So the kids get angry and mindlessly revolt against her. I'm sure ALL of the CEMU developers are doing the best that they can, updates won't bring as many crazy changes as often as they used to (and of course they're gonna have bugs, they're released every month or so).

1145,"spoilers may be included. saw this. came to the conclusion that the whole episode is an allusion to humanity and its everlasting pursuit for a purpose in life. The Lemongrabs represent humanity in its core essence,  collectively logical to a fault. Always trying to find meaning and justifying anything ever done. Whenever they encounter some mishap (such as creating more lemon people/ attacking the candy kingdom), they blame it to outside factors (Princess Bubblegum and Finn) for making them discover/""come to the conclusion"" to a justification for their actions (sort of like scientists justifying the discovery and use of atomic bombs due to the nature that they can be created). The Lemongrabs create life without a clear goal other than doing it because they believe that is what they are meant to do( ""Mother Creator meant for us to create lemon life!""). The placid faces and the shrieks they give are chaotic in nature, projecting no proper design. If the Lemongrabs are humanity, princess bubblegum is the grand creator that is able to create life full of life.

P.S. Lemon john represents humanity's collective fruits of labor, which in turn , through understanding and purpose, sustains the lemon people..."
1146,"Why are you playing Quick Play if you're gonna bitch at your teammates for not playing to your standards?

No, we probably won't build to your strategy.

No, we won't change our playstyle.

Yes, we're playing for fun, but also trying to win *our* way.

We play the heroes we enjoy and/or want to practice, not the hero you want us to play.

Quick Play should have a little ""Play for Fun"" disclaimer at the button, so people understand what it's for.

Reference to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/4qdndt/if_you_arent_playing_to_win_dont_play_competitive/) by /u/BAWLS_Life, and I think he's right but I also think it's worth bringing up how no one are entitled to demand any certain standard of gameplay from the pugs in Quick Play."
1147,"I'm asking this with a philosophical mindset. If you had to define what it means to be a good climber, what would you say?

Would you say that people are good climbers when they climb over a certain threshold of difficulty? Is the definition of ""good climber"" about strength or skill? For instance, ""A good climber is one that can boulder at least V5 and climb at least 5.11d."" 

Or is it something more than that? Is it about climbing gracefully or smoothly? Could someone who can only boulder V1 and climb 5.8 still be a ""good climber"" because they are particularly graceful?

I'm interested to hear what you have to say. I think there are some other related questions here: What about watching other people climb impresses you? What kinds of climbing-related goals do you aspire to? When are you happy with your climbing ability?"
1148,"I have slipped into a mental fog, a stupor caused by not doing anything to sharpen my mind or keep it active. I'm lazy and unproductive when I'm not working.

I won't be going back to school anytime soon, but still, I need something to keep my brain from feeling like it's atrophying."
1149,"Not everyone's life is perfect, and when we're down, we tend to embrace an artist, album, or song to use as our anthem.  However, what makes you identify with that particular music?  What about it makes it so poignant and relevant? If a friend or your offspring were having a rough time, what music would you hand them?"
1150,"Every year I take up a challenge. 2 years ago I challenged myself to listen to 365 different albums, the year before, I challenged myself to watch 100 movies and write reviews. But this year for me, I want to do something a bit different.

I'm at a point in my life where I want to make good life changes, and be an all around more productive person. At the end of 2012 I realized that I was not happy with the person I was, and was afraid of the person I would become if things kept going the same way. So I've decided its time to do something about it.

So keeping this central theme of self improvement in mind, I made it this year's challenge to read 50 books. But not just any 50 books, books that would make me more productive, more social, give me practical skills in business (I'm a marketing major), and just all around create a better individual in me. 

So this is where you guys come in. What books would you guys recommend for me? What books have changed your thought processes or just made you an all around better person? Anything in marketing, self improvement, time management, entrepreneurship, management, or anything that you could even think about would be great.

I also challenge my fellow redditors to also take up THE CHALLENGE. Thanks guys."

1159,"Her brown eyes stared at me with a confusing mélange of boredom and anger. She was leaning back on her chair, periodically tipping it off the ground and then back on the floor. “He was always there, right from our first successful night, until the last time I played. First I thought he was just a dedicated fan, but the way he always looked at me, it just seemed strange.”

Kiki kicked her chair back and for a moment it looked as if she wouldn’t be able to keep her balance. Then the wood clonked loudly back on the floor. Kiki leaned forwards. “Our success came really surprisingly. We’d been trying for years. We even changed our name to ‘Fat Breakfast’ because Josh met some girl from a label and she said our old name sucked.”

I was trying to figure her out. With her innocent face Kiki didn’t seem to belong to the world of professional music, the world of parties, late nights and excesses. But the way she spat words out like melon seeds on a sunny summer day was different. It was as if she had learned the surface levels of what it means to be in the industry, but it hadn’t reached her core yet.

“I remember our first really successful gig. It was at a place called ‘The BarK’, on a small wooden stage set into the back of the room. We were so demotivated from months of empty rooms that we didn’t even put up posters anymore. And when we arrived the bar was nearly empty, except for ten or so guys sitting in corners, drinking mostly by themselves. It was one of those gigs where they paid us $200, only so that they could put on their signs that they had live music every Thursday night.”

Kiki paused, both her words and her wobbling chair. “I’m still wondering at what time he came that night. I don’t remember seeing him when we started playing. And I definitely don’t remember seeing him ever before. But I remember exactly how I was scanning the room, how I noticed for the first time that there was a crowd. There were just five or six people standing near the stage, and another six or so at the bar, but the room had definitely filled. While Josh was playing a guitar solo with his usual antics I was looking around the room from the colorful bar and the black half-open door to the posters on the wooden walls. And then, only after I had seen every corner in the room, did I notice him, standing dead center in his long trench coat and a smug grin on his face. And even then, just in that first moment of seeing him, he was already staring at me.”

She smiled. “Everything went uphill from that night. Some college newspaper wrote about us, and the next day we got four calls from clubs that wanted to have us for a night, and they were paying us serious money for it. And then, after the second of those gigs, after we played with four hundred people dancing in front of us, then when I knew we had finally made it. All those hours and hours of practice in Josh’s garage and Crystal’s basement had finally paid off.”

“But even that night”, Kiki was nervously scratching her leg through her jeans. “I already felt something was wrong. It was like everything was fake, as if we didn’t deserve it. Is that really true, you have one great night and suddenly everything falls into place? After so many nights of failing again and again? It felt more like we had made a pact with the devil or something along those lines. I was thinking that while my voice filled the hall with other words, but then I lost my breath for a moment – when I saw him standing there, right in the center, with people dancing all around him. But he was wearing his trench coat and brown hat, even leather gloves. And he was fixated straight at me. And no matter how many more months I was in denial, that night I already knew that something was wrong.”

Kiki forced a smile. “We were so successful; it was unbelievable, at least for us. There were newspapers raving about us, actual newspapers! And then we even got a contract with a major label, just like that. The two men walked backstage during a break, layed a stack of papers on the table and told us to sign. I skimmed the contract, saw the rates and signed. Probably that wasn’t the smartest thing, but that night it seemed as if nothing, absolutely nothing could go wrong.”

“For the first month we were playing nearly every night.” I saw a flicker of exhaustion in Kiki’s eyes. “Every night, at placed all across the state. We played, fell into bed, woke up at 11am, had brunch and were shipped off to the next location. We all dropped out of college just because it was going so well. And every night, every single night I saw him standing there, in the middle of the dance floor, his trench coat was always closed and his pale skin and smug grin seemed to be gleaming at me.”

“He totally freaked me out, but nobody else seemed to notice him. On our first night off we were finally able to just hang out together. We had always done that before the thing with ‘Fat Breakfast’ lifted off, but that night, with Josh, Crystal and Nate at the table and our first paycheck in the bank, it all seemed surreal. It was as if we weren’t supposed to be normal people anymore. Every night we had these hundreds of strangers cheer us on – and suddenly we were back, sitting in a bar with just ourselves.”

“I have to say I got drunk that night. We all got totally wasted.” Kiki grimaced, as if she remembered the sour taste in her throat. “We just had so much money to spend, for the first time in our lives! We talked and drank late into the night, much later than we should have. Josh and Nate were speculating about our success and why the tables had suddenly turned in our favor. And Crystal and I were planning a shopping trip, which quickly turned into a fantasy of recording an album and touring around Europe. And then I dropped the bomb, asked her about the guy in the trench coat – but Crystal said she hadn’t noticed anyone. I interrupted the guys and asked them as well – but they too denied seeing anyone. They all looked at me as if I was insane.”

“I guess”, Kiki looked down. “That’s why I left earlier that night. I wanted to back to our trailer. It wasn’t even far, but with my blood saturated with sweet poison and the whole world seemingly shaking from left to right it took me a while to get back, fifteen minutes at least. And then I saw him, standing on the parking lot, just a few steps to the right of the trailer. He looked like every time, stiff and unmoving, only with his eyes fixed on me. Then he took a step; and quickly a second and a third. And again he stood, with this smug grin on his face, and his dark eyes focused straight at mine.”

Kiki shivered. “I threw up. It was like an instinct, a defense mechanism, like they tell you to pee yourself when someone is trying to rape you. I threw up, half on the street and half on the sidewalk, and when I looked back up he was gone. I was looking around the whole parking lot for a long time, I even lied on the floor so I could look under the trailer to see if he was behind – but he was just gone. And I stumbled back to the trailer, locked myself inside and grabbed a knife. I only woke up from the bangs on the trailer, the fists hitting against the door and window, and the shouts of the guys.”

“I quickly hid the knife and let them in. I knew they wouldn’t believe me. But I was happy not to be alone anymore.”

“We had a small concert the next night. We were all still hung over, but I suppose that’s something you need to learn if you want to be a musician – you always play, no matter how bad the drums are hurting your ears. I suppose that’s why Nate didn’t drum very well that night, but Crystal saved us with her violin. That was our thing – the mix of classical voice and violin with drums and guitar. Crystal played amazing that night and I was fascinated by how she was able to pull it off after all the drinking. And I saw the crowd was enjoying it.”

“The thing is”, Kiki cleared her throat. “I didn’t see him for most of the night. I kept looking to the back of the room and around the center, but he just wasn’t to be seen. And only at the end, when we were already at the second-to-last song, then I saw him again, standing at the end of the stage behind the speakers. Sure, the room was small, but he had always been right in the center. He had never moved. And he had certainly never been that close to us.”

“I was damn scared that night. On the way back to the trailer I made sure to walk back between Nate and Josh, just to be safe that nobody could somehow grab me and pull me away from the group. I didn’t see him after the show anymore, but he had stayed right till the end. He had stayed until the audience was already clearing out – and then, from one day to the next, I didn’t see him anymore.”

“The others denied seeing him again. Crystal was even teasing me, claiming that I had a crush on one of the fans, but Josh got that I was serious. I saw in his eyes that he was worried.”

Kiki looked down. “The next day I had coffee with Josh. Nate and Crystal were taunting us, that it looked like a date, but they knew that Josh and I were more like siblings. We had grown up right next to each other. Josh’s older sister even mock-married us when we were around ten, but that was just a joke. In the end I felt like he was the only one in the world that really understood me. He was the only one that knew me completely. And if I had known that that was the last time I saw him – “

Kiki burrowed her head in her arms and cried.

“Josh was just concerned about me”, Kiki’s strong voice had faded and her chair was standing solidly on the floor. “He didn’t even think about himself! He was just asking about me and how I was doing and what I meant when I kept talking about the guy. And I told him everything, how I had seen him every night, and how the guy had appeared on the parking lot, and Josh just held me and made me feel so safe.”

Tears were streaming down Kiki’s face. “He walked me back to the trailer and then he went out again to buy pizza for all of us. Why did I let him go? Just why?”

“And he just never came back. No sign. No call from him and his mobile went straight to voicemail. Nate and Crystal thought that he just met some girl, maybe a groupie, and hooked up with her. But I knew straight away that something was wrong. I knew it when my stomach cramped all night.”

“The next day, when we had our concert, he still wasn’t back. We had called everyone, absolutely everyone, and Crystal was furious and Nate was cursing him, but I knew that he would never do such a thing. He would never leave us like that. Still, the agent forced us to play. He got some other guitarist and gave him the sheets and the guy wasn’t even that bad, but it wasn’t the same. Not just because it wasn’t Josh playing. It was like we were broken, as if someone had taken our body and ripped the heart right out, but the rest kept walking and smiling. It was hard to sing that night, especially the songs that he had written, or the ones that I had written and that I first showed to him. Or just any songs.”

“And then”, Kiki bit her lips. “Then this round thing flew towards the stage. I thought it was a mug or plate, something to punish us for playing so badly, but when I heard Nate scream in the back I realized what it was. It was as if I had seen it but my brain didn’t want to understand it until there was no other option left. It was his head. Someone had thrown Josh’s head at us. And the thin man stood there again, in the center of the room, with his trench coat and hat and this time he had a wide grin on his face.”

“I told that all to the police”, Kiki was scratching her jeans again, but this time slowly and carefully. “I told them everything, and they checked the tapes, but they didn’t see anyone matching my description. They even showed me the tapes from the room, they were covering the whole room, and I could clearly see the middle of the room – and the man was standing there. I pointed that out to the officer, but he just denied it. He said there was nothing, just a glitch in the recording.”

“We took a hotel room that night. We slept all together in the same big bed, just to make sure that no one was alone. We talked and cried and at some point late at night we all fell asleep. We knew we would have to go back home the next day, to meet Josh’s parents and to explain to them something we couldn’t explain.”

“I woke up in the middle of the night. Not from anything particular, there wasn’t any noise or draft or light. I just woke up and it took a moment until reality sank in, until I realized that I was alone in the room.”

“I jumped out of bed and grabbed my phone to try and call them, first Crystal and then Nate, but both their phones were dead. And that’s when I knew. I didn’t even need to look. I just walked to the window, and he was standing there, on the parking lot of the hotel. Both their heads were dangling from his left hand.”

“And, while he was standing there, he was grinning. He didn’t move at all, only the hands were swinging in his hand. I was too shocked to even do anything. I was frozen in place, my hands and legs running cold as ice. I only managed to move again when he started moving his lips. He first opened his mouth slightly, then closed it, pursed his lips, opened them so wide that his teeth showed and then he stretched his lips back into this wide grin with his shining teeth. He repeated the same pattern three times.”

“The police found their heads just lying on the floor. From the tapes it looked as if Nate and Crystal had walked outside, just in their pajamas and without shoes. The tapes make it look as if they have these weird, glassy eyes. And then they just walked out of the front door and around the building.”

Kiki wiped her cheeks dry. “They never found their bodies. And they can’t even explain how the heads got in front of the building. The cameras malfunctioned. And nobody saw a thing. But I know. I know he was there. That was six years ago and I know he has always been there, every time I go on a stage, every time I open my mouth to sing I can see his smug grin, right at the center of the room. And the more people seem to enjoy my song, the broader is his grin.”

“He has never done anything since then. He has never even come closer. That’s why I keep singing. That’s why I feel I *have* to keep singing. I owe it to them. I owe it to Josh and Crystal and Nate.”

“I think about it every day. I even dream about his face moving. And now I know what his lips are saying when they open and close and stretch. It’s just two words:”

1178,"28 year old mother of two. 85 pounds lost in 8 months 

I've never been a tiny girl.. I'm not the one with the tiny little frame and size 0 jeans. I have curves.. But at 250 pounds I was fooling myself into thinking I was just ""curvy"". I was an idiot. 
In April 2010 I was putting on a pair of shoes and while bent over to lace them up I quickly got light headed and was unable to breathe, just from the simple fact that I was too fat to reach my feet! 
Something snapped in my head. 
I spent the next 4 months depressed and making excuses as to why I was overweight.. ""I had a kid"", ""I don't have time to workout"", ""I don't have time to cook healthy"" 
By November 2010 I had finally made the decision to change my future rather than make more excuses to cover up my laziness. 
I started walking, then jogging, then running. I found an amazing deal on some gym equipment and put it in my living room to make myself do it. I was following a low calorie diet and just basically holding myself accountable for my actions. 
The weight came off fast at first with many plateaus in between. 
By July of 2011 I had lost 80 pounds... And what happens when you lose weight and feel good about yourself? You make babies, duh! Lol 
I wasn't thrilled about the fact I would put weight back on, but happy to be a mother a second time. 
I tried to keep running even through the pregnancy but quickly realized I couldn't handle it. By the time my baby girl was born I was up 60 pounds! This time was a little different because I knew what it took to get it off and I knew there was no sense in making excuses. In June 2012 I got the ""ok"" from the DR to resume regular activity and off I went! Started running again but I was slooooooow as could be. With an average of an 11:30 min mile. But I was persistent, I downloaded MyFitnessPal and tracked my calories and exercise burns. 
By November 2012 my running pace was up to 8:30min miles and I had lost 50 pounds. I was feeling good again. I started ""insanity"" to help me up my progress and I saw amazing changes in my body! 
Over the last few months I have dropped another 35 pounds for a total of 85 pounds lost. I am at a running pace of 7:15min (flat) and I am training for a half marathon in May. I have finished ""insanity"" once and continue to do it every other day just to help me keep my muscle tone. My goal is to lose another 7-10 pounds and go for a full Marathon in Columbus Ohio this fall. 

I know what it is like to be obese.. I know what it's like to want the change but not have the drive to do it... But you have to.. You're the only one that can change YOU! More important that the weight loss and the better looks is my health! I am in the BEST shape of my life. 
If you want it go get it! Don't let anyone stop you.. Especially yourself! 
Patience and perseverance pays.

1196,"**EDIT:** Thanks for all the love and support everyone!  You've all helped me stay on track and be motivated to succeed - and I hope I've done the same for at least one person.  I decided to also tell my brother last night.  He came over, we had a beer, and I had him read the exact same email.  Now I have a team around me, and we're going to do a lot of things (internet filter, weekly checkins, more connections, volunteer work, possibly seeing a professional) to make sure I can overcome this.  We decided to let it soak in for the newcomers, and we're all going to sit down next week and make a plan.  I'm open to helping anybody on here via PM, so please let me know if I can help you.  And I'll try to reply to everyone, but thankfully I have a busy day on not touching my dick ahead of me!  Keep kicking ass everyone!

------------------

As you can see by my flair, I'm only on my second day.  After emailing with my mom earlier today, she said that she found of box of my old stuff and said: ""I am going to bring you the file as well because, my son, you were quite the stud in your young life.  So very many accolades.  Somewhere along the way, you seemed to quit believing in yourself.  I think it would be good for you to go through this file and see what you were and still are capable of.""

I replied that I already knew I was a failure, and then got into a bit of a pity party, telling her that I wished I could tell her the truth, but I just couldn't, and it would break her heart.  Of course, she's a mom, so she said I could tell her anything.  I decided to honey badger this shit and just lay it on her.  So I wrote a long email, and then texted her to get Dad and go read it in their bedroom (relatives live with them, don't want them involved).  In the hope that I can inspire other fapstronauts to get over their fear of involving loved ones in this transformation, I'm pasting the letter below (with redactions/changes for privacy)(also, my family isn't shy with the cussing, as you will see)**:**

-----------------------

What changed?  It wasn't really ""an event"", but a series of things.  You want to know, so I'll tell you, but I'd recommend that you are sitting down when you read this, because it's gonna hurt.

So I was much like most teenagers.  When it came to sex though, I was very naive and unprepared.  But since I was smart and good with computers, I found out a lot about sex from the internet.  I know you know that with how many times you caught me with porn.  Now, without grossing my out too much, I'm sure you've seen porn before.  Porn is not sex.  But it is a sex substitute.  I was quickly able to get a hold of a lot of porn.  Teenagers are horny, they masturbate a lot, and in these days, they watch porn.  So what?

Well, I lost my virginity at 16.  It was less exciting than I wanted it to be.  It felt good and all, but it wasn't porn.  It was quick, awkward, and then felt extremely weird afterward.  I'm sure you're familiar with the limited talks I had with you guys about sex - ""Wear a rubber"" was about the only advice Dad had for me.  Thankfully, I did follow that.

So I had sex a couple times, and then not for awhile.  In between, I watched plenty of porn.

The next time I tried to have sex (at 17 years old), I couldn't keep an erection.  Yes, ""this happens to all guys"", but holy shit was that a confidence killer.  The girl was really hot, I really liked her, there was no reason for things not to work.  But I wasn't really turned on.  It was sort of meh.  So that sucked, but I didn't give up.  I tried again - fail.  I tried again - fail.  I never tried again until college, because I thought college would solve my problems.  It didn't.

I met some girls at college.  Went on some dates.  Tried sex a couple of times - it didn't work.  So I retreated.  You know when I could keep an erection?   Watching porn.  So I went deep down the rabbit hole, and developed the horrible habits that I'm still trying to kick to this day.  Everyone masturbates from time to time, but I started masturbating 2, 3, 4 times/day.  Why do you think I dropped out of college?  You didn't honestly think it was just drugs and alcohol, did you?  I could skate through classes like it was nobodies business.  But I started staying home from class because my roommate was gone then, so I could watch porn.  It became what I did to pass time, when I was nervous, when I was tired, when I was anxious, when I was excited, when I had something to do, when I had nothing to do...

Remember that girl **** that I dated?  Why do you think we broke up?  Ugh, this is so awkward to be writing to my mom, but let me tell you something: there is no worse feeling than not being able to get an erection with a girl you are into.  She couldn't understand that it wasn't her.  And girls want to have sex - she was a cute girl, and wasn't going to wait around for a guy that couldn't get his dick to work properly.  That was pretty much the final shot for me.  I gave up.

Do you have any idea what life is like if you know (I know that's wrong, but its how I felt at the time) that you'll never pleasure a partner?  I wanted to get married and have kids, build a family, travel the world, have fun, and share it with a significan other.  Well, all of that was out the window.  I had no prospects for my future.  I tried to fill the void - I thought I could work myself through it, that didn't help.  I thought I could drug myself through it, that didn't help.  I thought setting big external goals like going to law school would help, it didn't.  By the time I graduated college, I was miserable.  I was working a shit job only because my mom had got it for me, I had a shit degree from a shit college that I wasn't going to do shit with.  None of my strategies had helped.  I couldn't care about a life where I wasn't ever going to be able to pleasure a woman.  I kept working at the law firm because fuck it, who cares?

At this point, I was still masturbating 2-6 times/day (I'm so sorry to gross you out).  Why did I quit the law firm?  Another strategy to try to get rid of this!  I thought that once I was in control of my life, I could kick the habit.  As I'm sure you can guess, that didn't happen.  Working from home only made it easier.  And with all the self doubt I had from this shit, I just kept feeding it.  Even when I was completely in control of my own life, I'd just waste the entire day in bed, hating myself, hating my life, hating what I had come to.  I made enough money to get by, but just barely.

Now, I'm at damn near rock bottom.  I have tens of thousands of dollars of credit card debt and nothing to show for it.  I haven't paid my student loans in a year - they are going to collections.  I own nothing, I have no plans for the future.  What's the point?  I can't ever have what I want.  I don't think you can possibly understand how bleak life is when you know you can never have what you want.

Somehow though, I haven't given up yet.  My back is against the wall.  I'm going to miss my credit card payments in a week, and then I really don't know what I'm going to do.  And it's not because I can't make money - I have people begging me to do work for them.  But whats the point of getting out of bed if you know that your whole day is just going to be spent hating yourself?  Some days I just wouldn't get out of bed at all, literally.  I'd cycle through porn and masturbation, smoking weed and browsing the internet, and crying myself back to sleep.  EVERYTHING in my life is because of this.

It's why I don't do anything with my life.  It's why I don't do stand up comedy, even though I'd be amazing at it.  It's why I never owned my own restaurant, even though it was a dream of mine and I'd kill it.  It's why I didn't go to law school.  WHAT IS THE POINT OF ANY OF THAT IF YOU WILL NEVER HAVE WHAT YOU WANT IN LIFE?  Why should I get up on stage and make girls laugh if I can't take any of them home with me?  Or worse - take them home and ruin the night because I can't get it up.  There are only so many times that a guy can see the ""What do you mean you can't get it up?"" face.  And unfortunately, I'm just not evil enough to only want money in life.  What's the point of having money if you can't spend it on taking a beautiful girl out to dinner because you know you can't take her home later?  You know why I quit playing soccer?  That abdominal pain I have? Its from ruining my pelvic muscles with constant masturbation.  I'm ruining myself, body and mind.

But, like I said, I haven't given up.  In fact, in the last year, I've discovered that I'm not alone, not at all - thousands of young men from all walks of life are currently in the same prison.  I really didn't think anyone else could possibly live this life and not kill themselves.  It's so horrible.  It's not a regular addiction like cigarettes or booze or drugs.  It's not something I can announce on facebook: ""Two days without porn everyone! Yay me!""  It's a prison that no one can see.  And, worst of all, it is completely free.  I don't have to rob or steal to get my fix, I just have to keep paying my comcast bill.  Speaking of that, some of my money problems do stem from porn - I was sued for illegally downloading movies.  I went to a lawyer, and he recommended that I just settle, even though I could probably beat it, but it would be long and public.  So I settled for $3500 that I didn't have.  Ugh.

But like I said, I haven't given up.  I'm trying to kick this horrible situation.  I don't know right now if you understand how grave this situation is for me, or if you think it's all a joke.  So here are a couple of links that might help:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSF82AwSDiU - The Great Porn Experiment - a TED talk by the leading researcher on this stuff.

www.yourbrainonporn.com - Information, resources, and support for people in my situation.

www.reddit.com/r/nofap - Where I'm going for support to try to get out of this.  It's semi-anonymous which helps me be open.

Most people that have successfully beat this problem go through the following phases: The tough initial stage (1-7 days), a clarity phase (8-30 days, give or take), a flat-line where you have 0 libido (at any time, usually only lasts a couple of weeks), and then it gets better, the libido comes charging back, the ED is gone, and sex is pleasurable again.  They advocate a no-PMO lifestyle (no Porn, Masturbation, or Orgasm).  This is only until you have rewired your brain to enjoy natural sex and respond to it appropriately.  Masturbation is not the demon, its the way we masturbate to modern pornography that makes the difference (pay attention to the part of the youtube clip where he shows that older people recover faster than younger people, because their problems didn't develop UNTIL they got high speed internet whereas the younger generation has always had it).

I've tried to quit this horrible, degrading, demotivating lifestyle multiple times.  I don't know if you've ever noticed, but whenever we go on family vacation, I'm usually pretty miserable on days 2-4.  Those are the days that I'm adjusting to not getting my fix.  I usually want to kill somebody when I wake up, but as the day goes along, and if we stay busy enough, I get through it.  But as soon as I get back home, it's right back to where I left off.

I've thought about asking my brothers for help, but I don't think they would understand.  I've sort of told ****** about some of it (gee - why do you think ****** and I have never got together?).  Hell, there was a point when I thought maybe I was just gay and I wasn't getting it, as I know others have speculated.  Well, I tried it out once, it didn't do it for me.  I told dad once that I was having erection problems, and he told me to go to the doctor.  I did, and he told me its nothing physical (I knew that, because I could easily get an erection with porn).  I even went to a psychologist for a bit, but that shit is mega expensive, and it seemed like I knew as much as he did (why do you think I took psychology classes in college?).

So there it is Ma.  That is what happened to me.  I don't think you can possibly comprehend the look on a girls face when she's begging you to fuck her and all you can say is ""I can't right now.""  I don't think you have any idea what it feels like to expect your life to be unfulfilling forever.  It's extremely hard to pursue your goals if you know you'll never be able to share them with anybody.  And please don't tell me that if I found the right girl, it wouldn't matter.  It DOES matter.  It's huge.  Women deserve a man that can love them, and they know that.  I wouldn't want any woman to be in a relationship with a guy that couldn't please her.  I've tried all sorts of relationships - with good girls, with bad girls, with girls I love, with girls I don't care about, even some morally unpopular choices - I was doing anything I could try to get a response.  But none of it mattered, and I'd just come home to watch more porn.

I know I've been a disappointment.  I don't want to be.  I want to change.  I'm trying, very hard.  And well, now that you know what the fuck my problem has been, now I'm asking for help.  Nothing specific, I don't even know how you possibly could help, but there will likely be a time in the next couple of months (if I stick with it), where I'm going to need help.

I can't wait to get past this.  I know I'm more than the person I have become.  I'm sooooo much more.  But I can't be that while I'm trapped in this self-imposed prison.  You're right - I want to fly.  But I'm a bird in a cage.  I'm trying to pry the fucking door open with one hand, while my other hand holds it closed.  If I can ever get out of here, watch out world.

You don't need to write back.  We can talk about this when we have lunch.  I don't know how I'm going to be able to look you in the eye at dinner Friday night.  But you wanted to know, and I know I need to tell you, so there it is.  I want to assure you that drugs and alcohol haven't ever been my problem.  Sure, like to drink and smoke pot, but so does everyone.  I don't even do either of those very much anymore.  My problem has always been the PMO addiction cycle.  Please watch the video so you can understand how hard this cycle is to break.

Yesterday, I committed myself to trying again.  I have to keep trying.  I'm the only person that put myself in this situation, so I'm the person that is going to get me out of it.  I can, and I will, I just have to stick with it.

Love you."
1197,"I just got on a train home from a meeting in London. I started my day at 5.30 to get to a 9am meeting, and as someone who prefers to get up around 9am and amble into work around 10 - which is of course eminently possible because with my preferred lifestyle choice (long term CF partner and two well trained dogs) I'm able to work till 5 or so, come home feed the dogs, make and eat dinner with my gorgeous girlfriend, then go up to my office and do a few hours more work. While I do this, my GF does some studying for her post grad course and then we go for a late dog walk. Basically I have a lovely life regulated by the times I choose, so 5.30am is not a time I ever see if I can avoid it - at least not from this end ;)

I digress, because I'm tired I headed for the quiet carriage of the train. I don't easily sleep on public transport unless I'm mortally tired, but I do like to shut my eyes and relax, ponder the day's events and often wrap my head around some of the more difficult challenges thrown up by my work (I'm an academic so a lot of my time is spent thinking about stuff). I got my seat, got comfortable and closed my eyes. At this point my happy little world was shattered by a piercing wail. I opened my eyes and looked around and what should I see but THREE of the tables in the QUIET carriage populated by small children. Then a phone rings behind me. One of the mothers answers, and has a conversation frankly reminiscent of early Dom Jolly sketches with (wait for it) her nanny! Yup she has more of the little bastards interfering with my peace and quiet from a distance. Slightly amusingly, the first thing she said was that she'd had to move from another carriage because there were reserved seats there. Does she think the quiet carriage is some kind of dumping ground?

Now I'd love to do something about this, but not only am I simply too polite to do anything other than silently fume and pass disparaging looks with other passengers, but I'm also British and thus it simply isn't in my character to make a scene - I simply couldn't bear the irony of having an argument with somebody over the lack of peace and quiet in a quiet carriage. But as I sit here behind the nearest mother (who to be fair has at least got off the phone for now, after three separate calls) listening to the children prattle on incessantly about bugger all, dearly wishing I hadn't left my headphones on my bedside table, and wondering how long it would take to just walk the 140 miles home, I'm reminded what a wonderful life I lead (the rest of the time) having found a partner who shares my views.

It's worth noting that I very nearly got trapped in a non CF life. My ex-wife decided she wanted kids, I told her I didn't, and she solved the problem by having an affair and getting pregnant. Not the best time in my life, but looking back I'm happier now than I ever was with my ex. I've shared the last four years of my life with the most wonderful girl I've ever met, I have two quiet dogs who I adore and best of all, everyone shuts the fuck up when I want some peace and quiet.

And people wonder why I use my car for most travelling...

Sorry to rant, I'll probably do it when I get home with my partner anyway, but right now she's at work, having lurked on /r/childfree for a while now, I felt somewhere amongst these kindred spirits is someone who'll read my venting and understand.

Love this sub.

TL;DR trying to relax on the quiet carriage of a train. Many many very loud children and a stunningly arrogant woman are ruining it for everyone.

Edit: Ah marvellous. Now one of the children has shat itself."

1202,"It's pretty well known that Wesley Crusher is not the most liked character in the Star Trek universe, and that despite this fact, it is also true that Wil Wheaton is wholehardetly *loved* by Star Trek fans and general geeks alike.

I grew up watching TNG in syndication, and out of order.  I never really grasped why fans didn't like Wesley, as he seemed (to me) to be in a handful of episodes, on and off, and while he was not a favorite character to me, he didn't seem terrible.  Then I watched the series in order for the first time, and realized that for nearly all of season 1, despite all their training and knowledge, the kid was always the savior of the crew.

Now, I'm a big Trek fan (as most of us here are).  I know most of the actors of each series by name, and I love seeing them in other shows.  In fact, I love seeing any actor I like in any other show (I was excited while watching *Lost* with my wife to recognize Daniel Dae Kim from his roles in *Voyager* and *Enterprise*).  I've also been known to seek out clips from actors I like, including (however somewhat ashamed) to watching a bit of *My Little Pony* to hear John De Lancie's voice acting.

What's interesting now, is that when I watch TNG, and I see Wesley Crusher, I'm no longer annoyed by him.  What I am is excited to see a character played by Wil Wheaton, because regardless of the character he plays, or even the fact that it is the role he's most known for, I *like* the guy so much, because of who he is now that I'm rooting for him to save the crew, every single time."

1206,"Please, tell me why Gravity Rush got great reviews. Sure, its fun at first, but now I'm playing it just to finish it and its a god damn chore.

I love Kat and the beautiful game world, but there isn't shit to do in it. Yes challenges, but no side missions. They mark on your map a few NPCs you can talk to and they have nothing interesting to say. The world is beautiful but bland as hell (Kinda like LA Noire). 

The enemies.... red blobs that that move around and hit you or spike out. Are they monsters or demonic flowers...completely uninteresting except for a few bosses.

Then your quest givers (Mission 18 anyone?) Idiots that can't do their own job and take advantage of the main characters good nature, I wanted to punch Kat for being a pushover and for putting me into another boring as hell Nevi fight.

Sorry about the rant ....I just don't get it. 

If you like this game, its cool, I'm not insulting your tastes, I just don't get why it got so much praise."

Please help. Thanks!"
1209,"To start, I'm 190/F/4'11"". Now, with that out of the way...

I just started counting calories yesterday and had a real eye-opening experience just now. Before preparing my standard breakfast (a veggie omelet, yogurt parfait, and toast), I decided to put everything into my [SparkPeople](http://www.sparkpeople.com) nutrition counter and was shocked at what I saw. I had been consuming over 1000 calories in JUST ONE MEAL! Ugh. 

But it was a beautiful thing. I was able to look at where I was spending those calories and where I could cut back. No EVOO, but olive oil spray. Saved 120 calories. A sprinkle of cheese instead of a handful. Saved 140 calories. No toast. Saved 200 calories. And it didn't stop there. It's amazing how quickly it all adds up when I genuinely thought I was doing myself a favor by eating a well-rounded meal. 

I just finished my new breakfast with reasonable portions and I'm just as satisfied, but I only ate 410 calories! 

My advice (and I know this isn't a new concept), put in what you plan on preparing into SparkPeople and see where you can modify to get the most bang for your buck. It was well worth it :-)

EDIT: 3 hours later and I'm still full! These are the positive life lessons I love to experience. I didn't restrict anything that I'm missing. It was a round meal with lots of protein and I feel great! Thanks for all the wonderful support Reddit. As someone who is a chronic worrier and catastrophic thinker, people telling me I'm doing something right has made this a lot easier. "

1224,"I've been waking up early these past few weeks to do WILD and I haven't had any success until today.

My alarm woke me up at 5:00. I got up to make me a cup of juice and stayed awake for about ten minutes. I tried to WILD, but ended up falling asleep. I woke up an hour later because of an upset stomach. I stayed up for about twenty minutes then went back to bed. I attempted to WILD again while laying on my side because it's much more comfortably than my back. I think I tossed and turned for about thirty minutes until I rolled over onto my back. I stayed on my back for about ten minutes when SP kicked in.

This was my first time experiencing SP so it took me by surprise. This tingling sensation engulfed my entire body and there was a loud ringing noise in my ears. I was really excited, but remained calm. Then I felt something pulling me under my blanket and started feeling like I was falling. I could hear and feel the wind rushing around me. Soon after I could see and I saw the most beautiful sky I have ever seen. Then my body switched to autopilot and began flying around. I didn't care about controlling myself. I was really enjoying the ride. I lost lucidity soon after and the dream turned into a normal dream.

I woke up and just thought ""Wow. That was amazing."" I thought about it for a few minutes then went back to sleep and after a few minutes the same thing happened. SP kicked in and I began falling. I was lucid a bit longer than the first dream, but it wasn't long before I lost lucidity and woke up.

I have gained new confidence through this experience and will try again tomorrow. I've just entered into a new level of lucid dreaming and it's a blast! I'm still excited!"

1230,"Hello everyone :)
This year I decided I would start reading again. So far I've read Foundation, The Humans, and Odyssey One: Into the Black (currently looking for the next two in the series.)

I'm looking for books that stick with the kind of story that odyssey one and the foundation series tell. That being one that starts with humanity in the present or near-ish future who have recently just begun travelling with faster-than-light technology, and stories about precursor species to humanity, etc. Or in the case of foundation, stories that span thousands or millions of years. If there's anything out there that fits all of the above, that would be amazing."

Restarting this epic adventure is emotionally exhausting. I feel like I have cheapened my first experience and that I'm going to fail again or (worse) accept failure and never change. My discipline is lacking already. 

But what are my other options? Quitting? Sitting back and putting on even more weight? The couch is comfortable, but the road once felt just as inviting. I want that done star back."

1241,"I've come back to faith in Jesus. After about four and a half years of atheism...

Just for a touch of back story: I was born to not-that-into-it Baptist parents (of an Arminian branch) and I converted to Catholicism when I was younger with quite a lot of zeal. My parents originally were against this and I was forbidden to go to a Catholic Church so I was actually baptized Methodist, but it was unsatisfying and finally my parents relented and let me join the RCC. They actually ended up very supportive. I adored the RCC and even felt called to ordination for most of my adolescence. In college, I drifted from the RCC and finally fell away completely. Issues of my sexuality, new philosophies, irritating theology study that seemed like I was always butting my head against a wall...all of it meant that I became an atheist and I became one **hard**. I viewed all those years of privately studying theology and patristics and languages as years that were *stolen* from me. I was angry. 


My pent up anger at sexuality issues, at my local parish's constant political ranting and poor liturgy (very, very bad at some points) came spilling up and got regurgitated out into a New Atheism that could strip the paint off the walls. I used blasphemy as a weapon. All the faithful were targets. I hated them. I hated myself. I longed to make them as miserable as I was. 


I never could shake religion though. The one quote that has stuck with me consistently in my spiritual journey is that beautiful quote from *The End of the Affair*: ""I have caught belief like a disease."" I never could shut up about Jesus. I hated him (so I said) but I couldn't get enough. I drove everyone near me almost to a breaking point because all I wanted to talk about was religion. I honestly couldn't swerve the conversation to anything besides this thing I claimed was a colossal waste of time. I tried desperately to make a non-theistic religious path work for me. I flirted with Pagans with loose beliefs about pantheism and tried until I was blue in the face to make Buddhism work for me. Hell, there are a couple of comments I've made just a few weeks ago (maybe less than that) on r/Buddhism trying to make it work, trying desperately to love anything...anything but Jesus. 


All that time bitching and moaning about Christianity...and it was all I read. Every nonfiction book. Whether it was rereading St. Augustine's *Confessions* or Karl Barth or Chesterton or whatever; it's all I gobbled down. It's all I grabbed at. 


Finally the other night I just stopped. I just stopped everything. I fell down on my bed and just admitted that I could run and screech and yell all I wanted but I couldn't stop it...I was in love with Christianity. I was in love Jesus. I was angry at the wrong thing. So I recommitted myself to my faith. I slowly removed the atheist bumper stickers and posters from my walls. I re-shelved my Bibles, theology books, religious memoirs, books on hermeneutics and church history (the ones I kept in the bottom drawer near my bed). And I felt this immense relief. Like my entire body just released. I felt that feeling you get when a horrid pain in your back finally lets go and you sigh in relief. Or I felt like someone who had been desperately trying to have conversations in a country where I wasn't fluent in the language and finally finding someone who spoke my own. I felt like I was coming home, to a warm home with my favorite meal already cooked and steaming.


I'm examining myself daily, reading as much as ever, and thinking about whether or not this entire experience might have been my freakish reaction/revolt against a true call to some ministry in my life (nothing specific as of yet, and doing this right...with an adviser and constant prayer). I'm joining the Episcopal Church (with which I've had a lot of experiences) within the next couple of weeks and starting back on that old ""disease of belief."" 


Thanks to this subreddit for giving me my daily fix of faith and being a part, however big or small, of the breaking point that brought back the deluge of faith into my life. 

Sorry about the length!"

1255,"Dear Sir or Madam,

I wish to make a formal complaint.  During my recent perusal of /r/proper I was both shocked and alarmed by harsh comments made on a multitude posts-- a large number of which contained snide jokes concerning people’s economic status in society.  In laymen’s terms, you have overused prejudiced and unfair terms like *peasant*.  

As we all know, one does not get to choose their place in our society.  It is because of the entitlements granted to us as the elite that we often look down upon others, but we must not stoop to such base levels of belittlement.  As gentlemen, and gentlewomen, we must rise above the rest and take a more couth means of approach. 

So next time you feel the urge to demean someone for their misuse of grammar, or their inability to understand what is or is not proper, I think a simple downvote should suffice.

When I first heard Pictures at an Exhibition I instantly fell in love. In the short thirty minutes it plays, it captures such a broad range of emotion in such an interesting way. Not to mention, there is a very interesting story behind the piece which you can read [here.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictures_at_an_Exhibition)

It has been my favorite single piece of music since I heard it about three years ago. I've listened to it over 100 times in its full and a countless many in parts. I loved it each and every time, but as what always happens I burnt out, but every now and then I still enjoy a listen. 

I (foolishly) thought I had heard every rendition, every version, every take from guitar to orchestra to piano. 

Then I heard this. 

It is simply the most beautiful thing I have ever heard, perfect in every way to my ear. The color, power and emotion he conveys with this single instrument is just amazing and as much as I love orchestral versions, manages to add what I would say is a bit of intimacy which is just impossible to convey in a larger setting. 

Anyway, I hope you enjoy the piece and this version as much as I do."

1264,"My classes are feeling more and more like a drag honestly. I am taking the summer off because this is my fifth semester in a row taking calsses and I need a break. I am just gonna chill, work a part time job ,make money, and have as much fun as I can have. 

Surely this will rejuvenate me next semester?"
1265,"Parents are always asking about grades whenever I visit or call them, and telling me that I should work harder and get better grades. It has come to a point that I'm becoming a nervous wreck. I'm trying. I really am. But they act worried, all the time- to the point that it grates at my nerves. I'm retaking a course in the summer, and they've just told me that I'll fail the course, because they 'know me'. 


I hate this. I hate this so much."

1267,"I am all for the idea of Endeavor getting better, but seeing people straight up excusing him, putting the whole blame on Rei or even arguing with people who don't like him makes me genuinely sick.

Just translating one of the comments from my country's platform: ""I feel really sorry that Endeavor is so disliked and people have issues with a cool pro hero, who provides for his family and overall shows positive dynamic, but not with a mom, who scarred her own child with boiling water"".

This was written by a female fan. Unironically. And it got the biggest number of upvotes in this post.

There is a huge difference between accepting redemption arc and people in the comments, that started crying after Endy gave his wife flowers and now ship them/want to be together again. It would be fine if it was just a weirdo minority, but there are TONS of people like that, a majority at some places.

What makes people straight up ignore canon for the sake of loving ""a cool, hot guy""?"

1284,"I doubt this post will go anywhere, but here it goes...  

I want to thank not only the developers, but also every moder and player of KSP.  It is truly an amazing game.  It makes me so glad that so many people are behind this game.  You have no idea how many times I've heard from people ""Why is space important anymore"", and its just so hard to convey my sense that its just so incredibly awesome to promote exploring the most dangerous and final frontier we know of...  I for one find that in itself enough of a reason to keep going to space on ridiculous missions.  What the KSP community has shown me is that people do really find it fascinating, the sense of ""Lets do it because... we're us"" is awesome even tho its just a video game... I mean, you could spend your free time on other finished video games winning achievements to gloat to your friends about, but instead you spend countless hours devoted to trying to solve a problem in a unique way, with really no reward other than to say ""Look what I did"" even if its only to yourself.  I am not sure if thats at all everyone, but thats what I do.

Trust me, this game has most of the stuff right on (although simplified obviously), but every one of my former fellow Aerospace Engineering students who I introduce to the game just say ""This game is amazing... I spent 20 hours on it last weekend"".  How I hook my fellow engineers is with this: ""KSP is kinda like porn for us Aerospace Engineers... watching porn is easier than going out and finding a girl that is willing to hook up with you.  Porn might not be as ultimately rewarding, but it sure as hell requires a lot less effort and is still fun as f#$k.""

Just wanted to say thanks from the Engineering community.

[Note:  I have only been working in the Aerospace Field for about a year after 5 years of college.]"

1286,"So in the science fiction video game Stellaris, there are some ancient civilizations played by AI that are above and beyond the technological capabilities of the player. These are kind of like the Q Continuum in Star Trek or the Consu in Old Man's War  - advanced alien races that rarely bother with the affairs of lesser races. 

Anyway, in this game one of these ascendant races offer to take control of one of the player's planet as a sort of wildlife preserve. 
The game is all based on Sci-fi tropes, but this isn't one I've seen before. Does anyone have any examples of this concept in other scifi?

1287,"My therapist told me to show gratitude. He told me that when I am feeling depressed, I should send a message to five friends on facebook telling them what I like about them.

I want to do this, but I am not sure if it comes across as creepy.

An example of a friend of 3 years:

""Hey X, 

You are one of the most genuine people I know. I love how much of a free spirit you are. You are inspiring to me. I appreciate you greatly. Thank you for being my friend.""

I mean, it's genuine. I really like this person. I just feel weird telling them. I dont know.

Edited for clarity.

Edit 2: I messaged seven people that I care about and respect. Guys and girls both. Each one I told them a few things that I liked about them and that I appreciated them. Only two of my closest guy friends I told I loved. All the responses were very positive. Some didnt even respond, but thats okay. I feel good about making others feel good.

1290,"Hey Print SF! I love you guys. I've had a ton of good recommendations from you, and I'm looking for my next book. 

The problem is, I've probably read most of the classics/regularly recommended books (the one miss was Blindsight/Echopraxia, but I corrected that and read both over the last month). 

I'm not looking for Cyberpunk - I've read and loved all the Gibson, and most other cyberpunk just feels pulpy and uninteresting (the modern stuff just feels derivative). 

I love most Alastair Reynolds (I saw most...but not all! Didn't like the Poseidon's Children series). 

I've read (and love) all of Kim Stanley Robinson's stuff. 
 

I'd love some recommendations for good, hard sci-fi. Or some good space opera. Something I long I can sink into over the next few cold months. 

Sorry if that isn't more specific, but I'm sure you guys will come back with something good for me. 

Also: I picked up American War by Omar El-Akkad, but haven't started it because I heard it was SUPER depressing...

1294,"What if I won the lottery...
What if I got my dream job...
What if I could ____...

""Meh.. that's just fairytale bullcrap that will NEVER happen to me. I'd probably find that I could effin' FLY before those other things happened...""

STOP.

When you ask yourself ""what if ____?"" and you write it off as stuff of ""fairytales"". You are choosing to believe something. I mean you never know. You MIGHT win the lottery, though the stats are not in your favor, it's still POSSIBLE. You want a know a way to never win the lottery? 100%? Never by a ticket. Yep, and never apply for that dream job.. and so forth..

For me, the fairytale that I've long chosen to not believe for myself is that some woman would ever love me. I've felt unwanted, unloved, unloveable, undesirable, unworthy by the opposite sex ever since I was 15. Funny how that's when I started PMO, isn't it? 

It was a lie. 

A huge ball bustin', no girlfriend gettin', pity party throwin', self-emasculating, tantrum throwin' LIE!!! I've been treating PMO like Gollum's ring. ""Nobody wants me but the PRECIOUS LOVES US!"" Just like the Ring betrayed it's bearers, my fellow fapstronauts, you mighty soldiers, you destroyers of shame, you studs that you ARE, you will be betrayed by PMO. Don't you already feel it? I sure as hell do. 

When we go back to PMO, we put the Ring back on and throw away everything that's good about ourselves and we're CHOOSING to believe a lie...that the possibility of some girl EVER returning our feelings and want physical intimacy (not that CHEAP FAKE PORN SHIT... I'm talking about the real thing that some of us have never had or haven't had for years) is so far away, it might as well BE a fairytale.

WELL OF COURSE IF YOU BELIEVE A LIE IT WILL BECOME TRUE FOR YOU! Tell yourself enough times you're unloveable and you'll believe it. You'll start living as though you are undesirable. You'll believe that the closest you'll get to living that fairytale is by reading OTHER PEOPLE'S story (and watching porn). Then you try and participate in that story by MO'ing. Weeaaaaak. And then the shame and guilt hits you. KA-SCARAM!!!! Yup. Reality sucks. You just woke up from trying to participate in someone else's 2-D story and found yourself unfulfilled, farther away than you've ever felt from a real woman's embrace. ""See??! I knew I was no good. What girl would want ME. I've got my pants around my ankles and I'm wiping off my pee-pee that was barely halfway erect."" Send a nice little thank you letter to your reward center in your brain because you just put on the ring.

Back to the fairytale. You want to know a good way to keep your dreams from EVER coming true? 
Put the ring on and go back to PMO.
Never ask a girl out.
Console yourself in your shame and misery with more PMO.
Don't invest in yourself or others.
Live vicariously through your fakebook reality.
Continue watching your reality TV.
Play MORE video games.
Don't EVER exercise.

What if.... what if... WHAT IF you changed the context of ""What if..."" from the realm of fairytale things that will never happen to you and made it an INVITATION to yourself? What if I.. becomes Why don't I?

Why don't... I put the video games away for a month (nah. for a year)...? Why don't... I delete my fakebook account? Why don't... I do 50 pushups before going to bed so my arms would be too tired to death grip half of an erection? Why don't I stop drinking/smoking cigs/weed? Why don't I quit PMO for 90 days.. what would my life be like? Why don't I purposefully go on a walk when I know triggers usually hit? Why don't I start exercising three days a week? What if I did all these things.. what kind of man would I become.  Level +10. Swag +100. Charm +100. Discipline +200. Irresistibility +500. Shame -100000. Guilt -100000. Chances that you'll ask someone out with level 99 confidence? Lucky 7777s, bitches!

Why don't you ask her out? Let me tell you a way she'll never go out with you, 100% guaranteed; if you never ask her and give HER the choice. If you make up her mind for her by not even giving her the option, you've sealed your fate. And a sure way you'll never ever ask her is if you put it off with PMO, and flog yourself with shame and guilt, solidifying in your mind that this is all you'll ever be and who would want that?  Good question.

The choice is yours. A brand new year starts tomorrow. 
What if 2013 was different?
Why don't you do something about it?

Ever since I was old enough to talk, I've been interested in food. I would watch the Food Network everyday. Simply fascinating to me. By the time I was 8 or 9, I watched nothing else. However, I stuck to the morning shows. 30 Minute Meals, Everyday Italian, Semi-Homemade and whatnot. Then I discovered Good Eats when I was maybe 10. I fell in love the first time I saw it. The way he combined food and science was amazing. *This* was why I loved food. I set my DVR to record it every time it was on. I watched it religiously, taking mental notes. I was still too young to really cook on my own, but I was stepping out. I made a lot of pasta. Being sure to always salt the water (kosher salt of course) and keep a close eye on my bechamel sauce. Looking back on it, those meals weren't good at all. But what do you expect from an 11 year old? I kept watching the show. Everyday. Sometimes if I'd watch them all, I'd turn around and start over, making sure I paid even better attention. I wanted to learn. I was cooking a lot of the meals around my house and by the time I was 12, I took over the kitchen completely. I made every meal, every day. I still wasn't great, but I was getting better. When I was 13, I had already developed at least 20 recipes on my own. All of them came from many mistakes, but once they were completed, they were pretty darn good. I was obviously getting better and I knew that I was on a fast track upwards. Now, at 14, I can cook almost whatever I want without a recipe. I know enough about flavor and technique to do that. I have dozens and dozens of recipes of my own. Things that I've imagined in my head and was able to display on a plate. Food is my creative outlet and I'm damn good at it. I owe that to myself for having the patience and work ethic, but none of that could've been shown without some knowledge. Thank you, Mr. Brown. Good Eats changed my life. I'm gonna be a chef one day, thanks to you. Keep being awesome. 

Now there's Adam Young. I don't have a big, extravagant story to go along with him and his work, but his music (Owl City) means a lot to me. I discovered him last year when I had a bit of depression going on (I can explain more if you want, but I don't wanna be one of those people that whines about it for attention) and it uplifted me. His voice, the lyrics, the sound.... Everything about it made me happy. I'd listen to it on replay for hours on end. Now it just has a special place in my heart (: He helped turn a little girls life upside down in the best way possible. 


So, there's that. I didn't realize it would be so long xD "

1302,"Hi it's Thom and Nigel in the studio... we'll be answering questions from 17:30 GMT / 12:30 EST

edit: that was fun, thanks for the questions.

Thom and Nigel: https://twitter.com/XLRECORDINGS/status/303559302717792257"
1303,"First, my rules: 

1)Permadeath

2)Trying to stay in character, sleep at inns at night, etc. (I didn't go overboard with eating and drinking and all, but at least kept a good semblance of role-playing)

3)NO re-loading when things go wrong. This REALLY made the game come alive, and even sparked one of the the defining moments in my character's story.  

EDIT: one more I forgot -- I only allowed myself to carry what I thought was ""reasonably realistic"" -- two weapons, a sheild, 6-8 potions, and stuff that would fit in my satchel like necklaces and stuff. It made money more valuable, made potions a more precious resource, and had the added bonus of taking out the looting obsession.

It was great. Decisions felt weighty, scary places feel scarier, epic fights feel.. well.. epic. This was my third attempt at permadeath. My first was a Khajit thief whose greed ended up getting him killed when he went after a treasure he knew he probably shouldn't (damn you Curalmil). The second was an Altmer who fell fighting Morokei. 

Talia was my third. Here's her story:

She was born in Cyrodiil -- the idealistic daughter of a legion soldier. She was turned down by the imperial army in Cyrodiil, but she knew they were begging for new recruits in Skyrim to deal with Ulfric’s rebellion, so she travelled to Skyrim by boat when she heard about the Stormcloak uprising (I used Alternate Start), eager to prove herself. She quickly made her way to Solitude to join up, almost getting herself killed for her overconfidence in her very first encounter along the way with a few roaming bandits. She quickly moved up the ranks, learning much about shield combat, archery, and smithing in as she went, and eschewing any kind of magic, which always scared her a bit due to the disdain for it that her father had instilled in her. As she took on more responsibility, she began to have doubts about some of the actions of the empire. It came to a head when something went terribly wrong on a secret mission for the imperials, and she ended up killing everyone in a peaceful tavern out in the middle of nowhere. She hid the bodies, stole a horse, fled in tears from the nightmarish scene, and vowed not to return to that life. 

She now had neither purpose nor family in an unfamiliar land. She was an outlaw to one side of the conflict, and a notorious enemy to the other. What's worse, she couldn't return to her home in Cyrodiil because she was now officially a deserter. She spent a good deal of time adrift in Skyrim, using the only skill she had -- killing. She cleared bandit dens and collected the bounties, spent her nights drinking herself stupid at inns and camping out in the wilds. Until one day she came upon news of a dragon, and was asked to bring this news to the Jarl of Whiterun. Feeling like she had a chance at redemption, or at least some purpose, she decided to help the people of Whiterun defend against it's impending attacker, secretly hoping she might be killed in the process. Something altogether different happened..

The rest would obviously filled with spoilers, but suffice to say she had many adventures, many close calls, made the best (and possibly only) friend she ever had, and lost him when he died defending her. With Alduin defeated and her journey complete, she has purchased a home in Whiterun next to her favorite smith shop, and found some semblance of peace.

..Though recently, there have been rumors of vampires, and she finds herself eyeing the chest that contains her faithful Dawnbreaker, knowing that sometime soon, she will have need of it again. 

EDIT 2: Great suggestion to include a picture, so here it is, complete with dialogue.

[""You've been up here for over an hour. What are you doing?""
""They're still out there.""
""Who?""
""The dragons. And now there's talk of vampires? When does it end? Plus.. I can't shake this feeling.. like there's someone else out there.""
""Yea, there's plenty of people out there.""
""No, I mean.. Someone.. ..like me.""
""Hah! Talia, I can tell you one thing, there's NO one like you. Now come on, my shifts over, I'm buying at the Mare.""

1315,"Hello,

I am visiting Johannesburg on a business trip (from Northern Europe) and am looking for interesting things to do and see on the weekends. I have already been to Soweto, Montecassino, the Lion Park and the usual places.

I have understood that there are informal settlements inhabited by whites in South Africa. My question is, would it be possible for me as a single white male to visit one of these places? Or would I be likely to get robbed or be physically hurt? Would I be able to have a relaxed conversation with the residents, or would they only like to talk about much they need a handout? 

I met a very poor white retired old man in Cape Town and regret I didn't talk to him more, because he seemed to have a lot of interesting stories to tell.

Give me your thoughts. Thanks!"

*I also found a lot of success with protein shakes mixed with cereal (Kashi, shredded wheat) or oatmeal, but that's really increasing my carb intake.
*I have also done quinoa, brown rice, and black beans (and have made/enjoyed black bean burgers), too.

Two big questions for the Veggit community:
1) What's the deal with tofu? Is there such a thing as too much tofu (especially for guys)? 
2) What are some of your favorite veggie dinners?

Thanks, guys!

UPDATE: Thanks so much for the insight. Re: the tofu question, I had been doing a lot of research online and, for the most part, was realizing I'd have to be consuming a ridiculous amount to even potentially cause any damage. Just wanted to confirm. 

I'll definitely be checking out seitan and experimenting more with beans. "

***end of update***

I found r/keto browsing /r/all. Being able to see the progress pic with ease piqued my interest and brought me in. *I would likely not be here otherwise*.

We vote to bring the things we want to the top. I'm sorry you mods don't like what we like, but deal with it. *We* make this a community, not you.

I'm starting a new subreddit, /r/freeketo. There will never be any moderation or restrictions there, ever. Feel free to join.

I am unsubbing from /r/keto. If you object to this decision, you should too.

EDIT: another option is /r/theketodiet, who have done a nice job getting their ball rolling and have promised to keep their moderation very hands off.

EDIT2: I'd like to bring some attention to a portion of andr50's comment. While I don't agree with all of it (I am recommending leaving), he does have a very good idea:

> If the mods are not happy about the science articles not hitting the top, they should do something similar to what /r/gaming did - keep /r/keto the catch-all, keep it the big, front-page keto sub, and spec the science to /r/ketoscience or something. Make ANOTHER place for jsut the stuff they want propagated, and keep the 50k+ subscribers who subscribed already because of what the community IS (not what they want / think it could it to be)

Whether this is a confidence issue, a struggle with organizing thoughts and putting them onto paper, or just ideas that are impractical on some level, I couldn't say. But it's frustrating when my list of ideas is far longer than my list of stories that I have even started.

1341,"Even though I think Don't Tread On Me is the weakest 311 album, I don't find it to be a ""bad"" album. The songs are generally good and catchy/melodic, the guitars and mixing is good, it's a short and sweet album. It could maybe have benefited from a better, less clean production, and have more memorable songs but that's the only critique I have.

I've also seen a lot of people commenting that the production on ""Uplifter"" and ""Universal Pulse"" ruins the albums, but I disagree. It's just different. I just think it's weird how ""Grassroots"" gets praised while ""Uplifter"" gets hated on when these two albums have a very similar style/production. (I personally prefer Uplifter over Grassroots.)

As the professor was going over grades he said he was disappointed in the fact of how many F's, a few D's, bunch of C's, few B's and 1 single A there was on the first exam. So here I am thinking to myself that okay I prepared but it's probably a high C. The professor hands the test back and says ""good job"" and I sit down and look at the score. I was the only A, I had a hard time fighting back the tears, and I'm welling up right now typing this. I can't express how proud I am of myself."

for example, in Eclipse you choose a direction and then explore. that's cool, but when you draw a tile you get to rotate it to face the direction that is most beneficial to you, or you can discard it if you don't want it. this makes sense for game balance but it doesn't make much sense in terms of flavor. why do you get to rotate an entire block of space? why do you get to discard that space and draw new space?

1417,"Howdy,
I wound up teaching an information and technology course at a secondary school in Africa, despite my background being in geography and philosophy. Now, we've had some set backs and our school doesn't have electricity to use our computers. To compensate, I've been teaching the history of computing hardware, mathematics, and technology in general. Today I finished up with the pre-electricity section... Monday I begin with computing technology in the early 20th century, and next week I'd like to focus on Turing if possible, because I find him very interesting.


The problem is, I don't understand a lot of the things I'm reading about him right now. For example, I have a rough understanding of what a Turing Machine is, and what a Universal Turing Machine is. I have a rough understanding of what he's getting at with it, but I'm not sure. So I guess my question is, what was so great about the Turing Machine theory? What was new about it? What previous theories/considerations/beliefs did Turing prove or disprove?

Would be very grateful of layman terms, as while I do understand some of it, my background isn't computer science.

1441,"I'm a Senior in High School and I love to write. When it comes to my classes that require writing short stories, I have no issues and they come out the way I want them. I also dabbled in fan fiction over the last few years and have no issues whenever I want to build on an already exiting universe with that author's cast of characters.

Now that I've tried to step away and write my own stuff, I find myself without any sense of direction or ideas. Some people write out of inspiration and others based on ideas that came to them, but I just don't have anything. I want to write, yet I have nothing to write about.

I know it's not possible to 'cure' a lack of creativity or idea building, but is there anything I can do to pull myself out of this rut? A common rule I see is 'just write' but I can't even do that. 

Edit: http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/15w4gk/7_sources_for_story_ideas/ I just saw this post on the subreddit and will try and apply this to my problem, but if anyone else has any ideas or input I'm all ears."

In our course section on women's issues, we were talking about things like the mommy tax (no paid leave means a reduction in pay for mothers who take time away from work to raise their new child), pink collar jobs (low paying jobs that are by far and away held by women like child care and housekeeping), etc. My professor said something interesting, that men and those with privilege can't be feminists unless they are willing to give up some or all their privilege. Fathers who take off the time to raise the newborn child instead of the mother, things like that. Do you agree with his statement? Can I only be a feminist if I give up some of my privilege? I'm not sure if this goes in this sub because I'm not criticizing feminism. I'm just wondering what the feminist perspective on my professors statement. "

But I don't love Jesus. I was asked the other day if I did, and I realized that I couldn't, with a clear conscience, say that. I respect and worship him, but I feel like that personal agape relationship that others seem to have escapes me - and I don't know why.

This morning the scale said 277lbs. I've still got a ways to go, but I'm no longer at risk of diabetes, my bloodwork has never been better, and I'm healthier than I've been in over a decade.

1507,"[Violence](http://www.costik.com/Violence%20RPG1.pdf) was originally written as a parody, to comment on the violent tropes in RPGs. However it is also actually playable. For those of you that are familiar with F.A.T.A.L., I'd say Violence has the same kind of vibes going on -- glorifying everything horrible and sadistic. However, Violence is much simpler to play. This was how our game of Violence turned out.  
  
I was playing both as DM and as a big, black, gun-toting thug with a PCP addiction named D'Andre. Since Violence is so rules-light compared to other RPGs, I won't even bother to comment on most of the details -- you all know how a D20 works. Another player was playing Candy, a blonde stripper with a cheery attitude. And the third player was playing Artie, a gangly white guy who thought he was Candy's boyfriend, and who dreamed of becoming a big shot crime lord with tons of cash.  
  
We started off in a shitty apartment in a shitty neighborhood with shitty crack-dealing neighbors. It's about midnight, and Candy was about to head out to her shift at the strip club, but the dumb bitch can't even remember the club's name. As Artie looks around our grungy, cramped apartment, it suddenly dawns on him what a shitty life we have, and the noisy cracked out neighbors next door send him over the edge. ""We better than this, ain't we?!"" he yells, grabbing a kitchen knife and heading out the door. ""Uh, yeah..."" D'Andre says, following him, curious of what he's gonna do. ""Are you gonna cook?"" asks Candy, ""Because the only thing I've eaten all day is some homeless guy's --"" but Artie tells her to shut up. He's sick of everything, and ready to kill.  
  
See, in Violence, our options are limited. We're fuckups, so we can't get real jobs too easily. We weren't able to afford much starting gear, so we're not too equipped to take down any big gangsters and move up the ladder. We can't go around asking questions, because there are plenty of other fuckup psychopaths out there that would rather shoot us than reveal anything about their various operations. And we can't really try and straighten out our lives because everyone in this town knows we're fuckups. So what do we do? We gotta find a way to hoist ourselves by our own bootstraps.  
  
But Artie's one step ahead of us all, apparently, and has decided that we're going to start moving up the criminal world career ladder, no matter who gets in our way. Step 1: Acquire cash and weapons. And our goddamn crack-dealing neighbors probably have both. He kicks in their door, catches them while they're too cracked out to properly process what's happening, and stabs them to death. They get a shot off from a little snub nose .380, but it misses. (And, according to the rules in the book, probably killed one of the illegal Guatemalan immigrants in the apartment across the street.) Candy's upset because apparently they had been her best customers after hours, but Artie's ecstatic about the $250 and 100 grams of dirty crack, not to mention the .380 with four bullets left. He asks D'Andre, ""Where do we go to get some real firepower, man?"" D'Andre says ""Dat some racist shit, cracka, askin' the brother where to get guns."" Candy says ""My pimp buys everything from Walmart."" Artie says ""YOUR PIMP?!"" And flies into a brief rage, expending our last four bullets in the dead crack neighbors' bodies. We hear sirens in the distance. Step 1 is still in progress, but now Artie adds a Step 2: Kill Candy's pimp and free the hookers.  
  
So we jack the crappy old Camaro that belonged to the crack dealers and Artie double-parks in the handicapped spot at Walmart. I thought it was a nice touch. Candy waits by the door while Artie and D'Andre head down to the sporting goods department. Artie grabs a shotgun, D'Andre grabs a .44 magnum, and they both load the guns and start stuffing their pockets with extra ammo. ""Now all we gotta do is sneak out the back,"" D'Andre says, confident that nobody was paying attention to the cameras in the store. But Artie was willing to bet that they HAD been caught stealing on camera, so he comes up with a better plan: He gives the first employee he sees some 12-gauge buckshot to the face, and then bolts for the door. He guns down the greeter on his way out.  
  
We meet back up in the parking lot, hear the sirens approaching, and jump into the Camaro. Artie floors it out of there. D'Andre is now getting antsy, he needs a fix of some PCP. The dirty crack's not going to cut it. Candy, in her infinite wisdom, suggests trading the crack for PCP. Artie thinks that idea is outstanding and logical. We stop when we see an alley with two shady characters hanging out, casually smoking a cigarette. ""Yo, you holding?"" Artie hisses out the window. ""Shut the fuck up, cracker ass,"" comes the reply. Artie interprets that as a ""Yes."" So Artie hops out of the car, and stabs one punk in the face and shoots the other point-blank with the shotgun. He recovers a wad of about $5,000 and - by luck of the dice - about a pound of PCP. These must have been gang-backed dealers, we decide, because that's a LOT. Artie assumes the punks were Yakuza, since they were Asian and his character is racist. Candy wants to try investigating the situation, and after careful consideration (and a bad die roll) informs us that Asians have small dicks. Thanks for the revelation, Candy, you're a huge help. We hop back in the car, and drive off. D'Andre snorts a healthy dose of sweet angel dust.  
  
Then suddenly, a car appears behind us, closing fast. Shots are fired. Artie assumes this must be the Yakuza coming for revenge (he wasn't far off from the truth), and demands that everyone return fire while he drives. D'Andre doesn't have much time before the effects of PCP take him, so he pops off a few shots. Candy fumbles with Artie's shotgun. Both cars have severe cosmetic damage from bullet holes. D'Andre hulks out and starts chewing on the driver's seat. Candy blasts their windshield with the shotgun, causing their car to swerve and then wrap itself around a telephone pole. D'Andre has eaten a good chunk of upholstery and foam, and punches out his own window, shouting to the world ""I AM BLACK JESUS, I LOVE IT WHEN YOU CALL ME BIG POPPA!"" Candy tries calming D'Andre down by flashing him, it doesn't work.  
  
Artie heads to the nice part of town while listening to a breaking report on the radio about three people going on a rampage. Y'know, us. Artie's ecstatic again, thinking we're starting to make a name for ourselves. Step 2 will have to wait, because we need to lie low for now and plan out just how we're going to kill Candy's pimp. Artie and Candy decide that the police probably won't think to look for us at a fancy hotel, so we head to the Ritz.  
  
We ditch the car in the parking lot, and Artie scares off the valet, threatening to kill him if he ever tells anyone. D'Andre passes out, and Candy and Artie barely manage to stuff him back into the car. Artie goes in and drops our wad of $5000 on the lobby desk, and demands two rooms. Luckily, the staff assume he's some sort of drunk, drugged out rock star, and politely accommodate him. He tips a concierge the $250 and some of the dirty crack in exchange for helping discretely carry D'Andre up to the room. D'Andre is put in one room, and Artie and Candy in the other. While D'Andre is unconscious, Artie and Candy are unfortunately free to scheme about how to make fast money in the most idiotic ways possible. They eventually settle on turning the hotel room into a HD porn studio, because porn makes lots of money, right? So now the plan is Step 2: Steal HD cameras from Best Buy, Step 3: Make porn, sell it for big bucks, Step 4: Acquire much better equipment, and Step 5: Kill Candy's pimp. Unfortunately, a member of the hotel staff gets a little nosy, and tries to find out what Artie's up to, so Artie stabs him, and drags his body into D'Andre's room. D'Andre wakes up in a fancy hotel room, on the floor, next to a dead guy. And that's where we had to stop for the night.

I can agree with you guys on Brin not being the best writer for this series. But I really loved the whole idea of uplifting and also the idea of ancient races and finding clues about these races. I read the books long ago and at the time I enjoyed them.

I do think that the uplift world would/could make for a good TV series, like GOT."

I think there are few words that feel as ugly and awkward as the word obese. Its the kind of word that always follows a sympathetic pause in the presence of the paunchy. It is so round and clinical and weighted down with taciturn lowness that it clings to a person in a way that squeezes and cripples him with what is simultaneously the most formidable and and the most elementary malady for a person to beat. January 5, marked one year since I resolved to change myself.This essay will probably be the most gushing and candid thing I’ve ever written, parts of this may seem attention seeking or boastful but I promise that this comes from the deepest, most sincere, and thought-worn parts of my heart. Its something I’ve had kicking around in my head for the better part of 15 years; this is the eulogy for my obesity.

Size has always dominated me, I began to chub around the fourth grade. I wouldn’t say that I was by any means a too-sad kid but I do think that feeling sad was a trigger for me. As a kid I had a difficult time finding a place where I felt like I was supposed to be. Whenever I would venture a try at something new, I would inevitably leave inadequate. I would feel bitter about being rejected by girls or I would feel sad about not being able to keep up with boys. In response I withdrew and went to food. As I grew up, I never felt right and I never I had anything that was mine with which to excel…I would fantasize about accomplishment and taking ownership of the kind of charisma and strength that would enamour me to those girls and make myself a hero in the minds of those guys, but I had lost so much ground over time that the idea of changing anything was daunting. It felt like my life was looming over me and I used food and humor as a means to swat it.

Gaining weight was mostly gradual with a few sharp spikes. It went on slowly until one day I realized that I was a fat kid and at once the idea got stuck in my head. I remember this feeling of compliance like:""well, this is me now."" As I grew older and boundaries widened, I became heavier. I would ride my bike to the Meijer on Clyde Park when it had a McDonalds in it and I would eat a Double Quarter meal Super-Sized and a twenty-piece chicken nuggets, turn around and ride home. This secret meal would lay on top of everything else I eaten during the day and I would enjoy it with stealth in my mind. It didn’t help that I was also slow to develop socially; I didn't have friends yet and food became music for me. It entertained and occupied me. I would go to movies by myself (which I loved doing) I would devour my lonely popcorn and inhale my propitious Pepsi. With every little bit of freedom I enjoyed, my weight gain would apex and level off. When I got my first job (at a pizza joint) I had tons of free food and money to spend on whatever I liked, when I got my license I could travel farther for different brands and combinations of fast food. Every bit of independance further cemented my habits.

Eventually I did develop a bit of a social lean but I still had a hard time accepting myself to my peers, I always felt like my stature stood between us. For example, one year we went to Michigan Adventure, I hadn’t thought much about the seat in a roller coaster and and never had a problem with a lap bar, but then I got in line for The Corkscrew. We waited eagerly and when the time came I walked up to the cart and looked inside and I thought ""shit."" I sat down next to a friend and it was tight but we were both able to sit. I reach up to pull down the shoulder harness and it wouldn’t click. My chest is too far from my back to get the harness to lock. I want to get out but instead an employee comes to me and tries to help by pressing it into me while I 'suck it in' No dice. I stood up and walked away with all the eyes on my back. I held the ride up and I was that fat kid that didn’t fit so I watched my friends ride the coaster from the sidewalk. It was the first time my size made me feel t isolated in front of someone. My attitude was to quietly tack roller coasters on to a list of things I couldn’t do. Eventually I out grew movie theater seats, airplane seats, and ‘Big & Tall’ sections in the mall and I passively waved goodbye to all of them.

And time just passed by - I built powerful, lasting, and comfortable relationships. I worked and had fun but never really achieved anything. I had quiet goals but all of the things I wanted for myself came to be plain conversational fodder, things you get drunk and dream about out loud. Everything I wanted was so public and everything I was was so private. I wanted to act and I wanted to be a comedian. I did open mics and it left me disgusted and exposed, it was a sort of exhilarating misery that kept you facing the goals you pushed away. I gradually lost momentum and just sort of stalled. Life for a few years was like a room dimly lit by the flickering light of a TV. It was quiet, and private, and comfortable. I remained stealthily obsessed with food. It occupied my mind. The flavors and textures and that feeling of occupation in your core gave me a sense of contentment that was so durable that it became ever-present in my life.

I haven’t always lacked a sense of the need for change. Periodically, I would have manic bouts of conviction and backbone. I would face the world and strive to be social, and better, and healthy. I would purse comedy again, I joined gyms, I sought and gained relationships...complacency though eventually had me back in my room eroding from a habit bordering agoraphobia. Eventually I realized that I wasn’t the possessor friends I once was and I became aware of the cheerlessness I felt for myself and that revealed to me the delicacy of the relationships I had. I was pushing people away from me so that I could revel in my faults. I began to see the folly and futility of so many of the years behind me. I became morbidly mindful of my mortality; I would imagine a roommate finding me dead and how they would react. How my family would react. In that, I realized that I’d lived so absent mindedly for so long that I had become OK with being dead when I was 40 and had subconsciously planned to be alone and idle for whatever time I had left. I’d let indulgence and apathy become intuitive.

A dramatic shift in my mindset came to pass around summer 2011. It was also around this time that I, as none of my friends or family knew, auditioned for a weight loss reality show. On the show, overweight men and women are taken away to a fitness sanctuary where they are taught healthy habits and exercise and exercise and exercise ... it was much like a real-life adult version of the movie Heavyweights. While gone, participants don’t communicate with family or friends and then, after an agonizing and heart lifting episode is complete, they are revealed to friends and family in a new body and attitude. I wanted to be a part of that show and thought I had it. I was interviewed and inline to be a part of the show when, abruptly, the series was put on hold and the new season never materialized.

I was devastated. I had poured my future into this idea that I could be taken away and fixed. That I was going to leave and come back as a new person for everyone to hold up cheer for. I had built up tremendous optimism and lost it all just as quickly. I went right back onto the destructive beat I had just left. Looking back, not making it on that show broke something for me and pushed me to get bad enough that I could get better.

Fortunately it only took about six months, I grieved the loss of my spotlight and my champion transformative moment and during that time reflected soulfully about who I am to the people in my life, who I am to myself, and most importantly recognized that I have it in myself to become the kind of person I want to be: I want to constantly be aware of my potential. I want to be a man that knows and practices right from wrong. I want to modestly inspire goodness, optimism, and effort in people; I want my integrity and my character to be something worth holding up. I want to be external and in the lives of people and I want people to feel that having me in their lives is a thing of value. In order to realize these things I had to accept accountability for what had misrepresented my capability and demeaned my resolve for so long. It wasn’t my weight, it was my attitude about life and an enduring lack of enthusiasm for the future.

I took responsibility for my well being one year ago, I weighed 420 pounds, I wore a XXXXXL dress shirt and 48 jeans. My life and the way I lived it literally changed overnight and hasn’t stumbled. I began by eating a calorie restricted diet and eventually shifted to focus on lower carbohydrates. For exercise I started by walking three miles a day. I would take the bus to school, get off walk a ways and get back on further down the route. Once spring rolled around I began to bike. Those rides progressed from two, to six, to ten mile rides, mostly to and from school. Soon the distance between school and home wasn’t clear or long enough so riding became a purposeful thing rather than utility. I rode and rode. By the end of the summer I had joined the half century club having ridden over fifty miles in one ride. In August I began running using the Couch to 5k program and ran my first full 5k on November 17 and putted along to finish my first 10k on December 15. As of today I have lost 178 pounds, wear a large and 34 jeans. I am stronger and faster than I’ve ever felt myself be. I feel appreciation and optimism in everything that I do and I sense that this is the way life should feel. I’ve still got a lot of work to do but at this point the habits have rooted and the education that I’ve gained over the last year will nurture them. I cannot see my life going backwards, this is who I was always supposed to be.

I’ve spent most of my life planning and daydreaming without action and now everything seems so attainable.This is why I write today, I’m ready to say goodbye to that old life now and to focus on maintaining goal oriented momentum and pushing harder so that the strength in my musings becomes the strength in my character. I can do better, I can do better. I can be the Greatest Man in the World.

Thank you to Mom, my Dad, Jerry, My brothers Eric and Adam, Jessica, Marshall, Corey, Colby; you guys specifically have given me clarity and always been frank with be about delicate things. And to Britt, Allen, Jen, Margie, and Alex, you guys give me the happiness I need to suck it up and do it. This might all seem overly sentimental but I only plan on doing this once and you’ve changed my life in ways that can’t really make sense to you.

Part of the audition process for the reality show I mentioned was to create a series of videos focusing on different aspects of my life. I edited one of them and am keeping a few private, but as for the rest, I don’t see a reason to keep it closeted anymore, I feel like that person is gone now. I uploaded these in May 2011, until now it has been accessible only to the producers of the show. For those interested, I have the links listed below. I think they are a thought-provoking relic.

1519,"**Hi Loseit. It was suggested I crosspost this here. Hopefully someone finds it motivational!**

Hi Leangains,

Since I have found so much inspiration in this community, I figured I would try to provide some inspiration of my own. I present my one year journey:

http://i.imgur.com/8rz6X.jpg

The **long story:** I was a fat fuck. I was 255 pounds, had stage two hypertension, suffered a stroke, and had a myriad of other health problems. Couldn't walk a flight of stairs, couldn't lift a fucking thing. After my stroke, I split up with my fiance of 7 years. That was it. I decided enough was enough.

The first couple of months were me being mopey and starving myself. I dropped 20 pounds in the first few weeks. Losing weight was awesome. I wanted more. I spent every waking moment researching fitness and nutrition. I quickly dispelled all the bullshit magazine myths about stupid workout routines and decided I wanted to gain strength and not look like a fat fuck anymore. I started IF in February of 2012, started LG in July. I busted my ass on a 3 day split and forced myself to add weight every time I hit the gym. I progressed quickly on DL/Squat, but my bench was abysmal (and still is), and I couldn't do a pull-up; not even a neg. I didn't let that shit deter me, and I kept at it. I tweaked my diet, I pushed myself hard, and I would not relent.

At first it was pretty basic LG. Once I hit 200/300/400, I decided to switch to a hypertrophy routine. I have dicked around with my diet and routine somewhat over the span of my training, but the core has been the same: Do the big 5 and lift heavy shit. I know im no supermodel and I still have a loooooong way to go; I just wanted to share this with the community and hopefully motivate someone just like me to stop allowing mediocrity to rule their life and get their shit together.

Thanks to this awesome community that has contributed to my success, and many others. I sincerely hope at least one person sees this and decides to make a change in their life.

**TL:DR** Fat fuck turns his life around and loses 75 pounds while joining the 200/300/400 club in less than a year."

EDIT: Some are asking what I mean by wilderness, so I'll attempt to elaborate. I described it in this way below: ""By wilderness I could mean either [unspoiled or bleak wasteland].

Is it how topical or a-topical the subject is? Or, how exhausted a style seems at the time? Do some movies go out of fashion only to, later, re-emerge as being relevant?

Factors that could help play a part: income(non-genetic), disabilities(could be non-genetic or genetic)...

Note: I post this question not because I despise those who ""can't"". I ask wonder about this because of a recent surgery to fix a problem I was born with which put me in a 'lesser' position than the majority in the past + biology studies.

1580,"I am in college studying design to become a scenic designer. I have always loved designing spaces and have been getting good grades in my design classes. One of the things that is required for me to graduate is that I complete a summer internship. My problem is that though I have been doing my research, for the past 3 years, on which internships I would like to apply for to fulfill this requirement, there are quite a few that are not being offered this year. There are many implications to the possibility that I do not get an internship for the summer, the worst being that I will not graduate on time. 

I am, of course, freaking out. 

The other problem I am having is that I am required to provide a portfolio for these internships and while I have enough material that I am proud of, I am having a really hard time putting it into an acceptable format. I have a crappy layout that I put together quickly to just start working with it but the more I think about it the more horrifying it becomes. So recently I have been avoiding working on it at all because I am chocking so badly on providing a graphic layout for my projects.

I have no idea how to fix either of these problems and the deadlines for the internship applications that I do know about are closing in. I was hoping that someone out there in /r/Design could provide me with some insight on how to get over designer's block and maybe even some internship suggestions? Anything would be appreciated.

TL;DR: I have very few internships to apply for, and I need one to graduate. I am also having major portfolio layout issues."

Sorry I didn't know how to make albums(:
**however**... I am proud of what I accomplished :)

**edit** how did I loose my 60 lbs? Well it started because I wasn't pleased with myself, and because ""friends"" in school bullied me. I was asked being pregnant just so that they could make fun of me. I wanted to show them, and myself what I am. T
I wanted my personality to show (which it didn't because no one gave me a chance to do it. At first I did it all wrong. I stopped eating, then I binged. Then I stopped, then I binged. After seeing small positive changes on the scale I started to take 5 km walks. Then I decided to eat healthy. 
Every day in the beginning I walked 5 or 10 km (I still do) then when I got lighter I started running. I hated it. HATED. but then I decided to sign up for a 10 km marathon. After that, I loved running. Now I run a lot. I also work out at the gym. About 3 times every week. I love doing the bench. Something I did during my first year was to cut off **all** the crap. I didn't eat *any* snacks, any candy... Barely anything unhealthy in a year. The most unhealthy I had was jam or white bread. I guess that's my story. I'm planning to loose about 15-20 more pounds, then I think I'm pleased.

It's strange, because SpaceX launches are usually big public events, and everyone is well aware in advance of what's going on, but apparently many people were taken by surprise here. Perhaps it's because of the launch location being, well, very different from the norm.

But maybe there's something more to it. Maybe awareness wasn't wanted. Panic and confusion and speculation occurred. Maybe this was engineered, and the reactions measured.

1602,"**We are software engineers at SpaceX.  We work on:**

* Code that goes on rockets and spacecraft.
* Code that supports the design and manufacturing process of rockets and spacecraft.

We work on everything from large-scale web applications to tiny embedded computing platforms.  We build tech stacks on C#/MVC4/EF/MSSQL via REST to Javascript/Knockout/Handlebars/LESS, C++/Embedded Linux, Python, LabVIEW… which all together enables us to build, launch, and monitor stuff that goes to space.


**Some videos of our recent work:**

**Proof:**

http://imgur.com/bl8dlZ2

Edit: Poor Dan, everyone knows he was photo-shopped. Don't close your eyes next time! 

Edit 2 : We've been getting a lot of questions about how C#/MVC/etc have to do with rockets. They don't. At SpaceX we have 4 separate software teams:

1.  The Flight Software team is about 35 people.  We write all the code for Falcon 9, Grasshopper, and Dragon applications; and do the core platform work, also on those vehicles; we also write simulation software; test the flight code; write the communications and analysis software, deployed in our ground stations.  We also work in Mission Control to support active missions.

2. The Enterprise Information Systems team builds the internal software systems that makes spacex run. We wear many hats, but the flagship product we develop and release is an internal web application that nearly every person in the company uses. This includes the people that are creating purchase orders and filling our part inventory, engineers creating designs and work orders with those parts, technicians on the floor clocking in and seeing what today's work will be per those designs...and literally everything in between. There are commercially available products that do this but ours kicks major ass! SpaceX is transforming from a research and engineering company into a manufacturing one - which is critical to our success - and our team is on the forefront of making that happen. We leverage C#/MVC4/EF/SQL; Javascript/Knockout/Handlebars/LESS/etc and a super sexy REST API.

3. The Ground Software team is about 9 people. We primarily code in LabVIEW.  We develop the GUIs used in Mission and Launch control, for engineers and operators to monitor vehicle telemetry and command the rocket, spacecraft, and pad support equipment.  We are pushing high bandwidth data around a highly distributed system and implementing complex user interfaces with strict requirements to ensure operators can control and evaluate spacecraft in a timely manner.

4. The Avionics Test team works with the avionics hardware designers to write software for testing.  We catch problems with the hardware early; when it's time for integration and testing with flight software it better be a working unit.  The main objective is to write very comprehensive and robust software to be able to automate finding issues with the hardware at high volume.  The software usually runs during mechanical environmental tests.

Edit 3: Yes, we are doing a ton of hiring for these software positions that we have been talking about today. Interns and New Grads too! 

Edit 4: Thank you so much everyone! This is ending but most of the group will be back at 2:00pmPST to answer more questions. 

Edit 5: ...and we're back! Engineers from each of our engineering teams are present. Let us catch up a bit and start swering again (probably be about 5 minutes).

For all open software related positions, please go to http://www.spacex.com/software.php

**Edit 6: Thank you so much Reddit! This was a ton of fun. To all those asking about internships and employment, our suggestion is to apply online. Your resume will definitely get read. To all the students out there, GL with your midterms coming up and stick at it. Try and work on some side projects and get as much practical experience coding as possible before graduating. Happy Friday everyone!**

1603,"I had to make my first post today thanking r/Keto. About a month ago I became fed up with being fat and I took before pictures. I studied this diet and started it up. I have started probably a million diets before but this time I really am taking steps to change my life and not my waist. 

About two years ago I lost enough weight to categorize myself as just ""overweight"" and not obese. I lost about 60lbs from just counting calories. I gained it all back in about one semester of school and life happening. I became aware that keeping myself at about 1,500 calories was just not happening for me and I gained so much weight I decided I just wanted to get surgery. After some crushing calls to my insurance company I learned that because I lost weight myself I would not qualify unless I stayed morbidly obese for the next three years. 

At this point I almost lost hope until I stumbled upon this subreddit. A month later I am ten lbs lighter. Yesterday I gave all my canned corn and carb loaded pastas to a friend because I never plan on eating those things again.  Some of those things I have had for over five years and keeping ""just in case"". I also went to see a doctor about my weight loss for the first time. I told him what I was doing and we did my blood work. Today we met to talk about my results, supplements and... and I made an appointment for 3months and 6 months later. I have NEVER done this before. I even ate brussels sprouts today, something I have never willingly done before. But my life has to change I know that if I don't adapt this new life style I have a life of diabetes and heart problems ahead of me. 

I read everyone's amazing stories on here and they inspire me so much. Thank you everyone and I hope to be seeing this subreddit for many years to come. "

1607,"Particularly of people from a trade background who were working at more of a technician level and wanted to go further. What are the pros and cons of doing a degree later in life, particularly one done part time over several (up to 8) years? 

What benefits does the prior practical experience (and perhaps also life experience) offer and what sort of position do you see these adult students ending up in?

I personally am a very hands on person with a burning desire to understand how everything works. Yet I could not cope being at a desk for long periods of time, nor am I particularly great at mathematical calculations, compared to many other people. 

I'd like to do a degree in electrical engineering part time (takes 8 years, I'd finish at age 36) to test my limits and see what I can achieve, but I'm not sure what kind of employment options suited to me will become available once I am finished. I may end up just an over-qualified electrical/instrument technician (which would be OK I suppose) but I would hope I can put the skills to use in some kind of design work. Are there a lot of on site engineers out there, who are very hands on? Perhaps even in troubleshooting or reliability, rather than new construction?

I've also been looking at a degree in process control, which is something new since about 2011 where I live, and seems to be based around manufacturing and a combination of electrical, industrial electronic controllers, and some mechanical. To me it sounds a bit like mechatronics but for big scale industrial, but I could be wrong there. If anyone has any specific advice on this type of degree it would be appreciated."

Ive also extended the franchise to every citizen and the majority seem pretty content with many getting there full luxury needs. Secret Ballots have been made available and the upper house is very liberally elected now. 

I have sphered much of South America, Japan and Korea and my only wars have been taking Cali, AZ, Texas etc from Mexico and keeping France out of my ally Brazil. I could have pushed further and taken almost all of Mexico but I plan to bring them back under my wing as an ally later on.

I dont plan to colonize/take anywhere, except the Panama canal and maybe some Islands in Asia. Maybe the only wars I will consider are liberating Cuba, Guyana etc. from the Europeans?

My plan is to get mega rich, mega powerful militarily and industrially, push as liberal a reform agenda as possible and cruise in and help any democracies abroad in wars where possible.

And just about every time, there's someone here who decides to tell them they're being pathetic or gives them the worst advice I've ever seen.

The way I see it, we're all here for the same reason: we seek to improve ourselves.   We all start from different places, but we usually travel similar paths with self doubt, weakness, the works.    So why do some here feel the need to berate and insult as opposed to contribute and uplift?

Look, I know it's the internet, and there's zero accountability so naturally that brings out the worst in human nature, but that's also how communities go downhill quick.

So here I am thinking to myself that okay I prepared but it's probably a high C. The professor hands the test back and says ""good job"" and I sit down and look at the score.

In this hectic world we often pass and forget that small things may be the most important. To celebrate my new apartment and coming pay day I want to remind you all to open your eyes and find those things that are often forgotten or missed. 

**Rules:**

* Open your eyes, ears and heart.
* Find something small that would be passed in this hectic life but which is beautiful, full of emotion, memories or something else as important.
* Take a picture if possible!
* Post the picture here with explanation why do you think this small thing is important to you, those near you or to us all and why it should be forgotten.

The most inspirational small thing will earn to it's finder something small from their Wishlist. Contest will end on 14th of February because you should never forget your loved ones.

Have a open mind and heart, always remember to stop and take a breath!

**EDIT:** It can be a thing, place, moment, flower, person, anything that is small but still very important. It can also be something that represents an idea or a thought that we all should always carry with us. Use your imagination!

**4. EDIT:** Reading your comments made me realize that this contest is more than just stamping photos. So changed the rule about the time stamping optional. The important thing is that you post something that is small, but meaningful to you or everyone. Sorry for these changes, but I feel this is a contest everyone should be able to participate with a story. You can also participate more than once. So if you happen to come across something inspirational in your life before the contest ends, do not hesitate to post again. :)

**THE CONTEST HAS ENDED: I want to read through all the entries again and choosing the winner will take a while because all of you told amazing stories. I want to say to you that even if you don't win this one, you have shared something beautiful and it is very important and matters a lot to others, at least to me. I want to thank you all for taking part and sharing your stories and loved people, animals and things with us all. You are lovely <3**"

1652,"Hello. As the title says, I bought my first copy of the Quran. Is there something I should know before I start reading? I know tafseers are important, but I plan on reading the text without it for now, if that's ok.

Can I read from start to finish? Or is there some other order?

Also, I know translation qualities are important, so I'll provide a few verses for your comparison.

The translation is by Abdullah Yusuf Ali

5:77 Say: ""O people of the Book! Exceed not in your religion the bounds (of what is proper), trespassing beyond the truth, nor follow the vain desires of people who went wrong in times gone by- who mislead many, and strayed (themselves), from the even Way.

24:57 Never do think you that the Unbelievers are going to frustrate (Allah's plan) on Earth: their abode is the Fire - and it is indeed an evil refuge!

48:28 It is He who has sent his Messenger with guidance and the Religion of Truth , to proclaim it over all religion: and enough is Allah for a Witness.

Thanks

By all means speak your mind, but also remember that the people who made this worked long and hard for meager compensation, and they did it out of *generosity* and the *kindness* of their hearts, because they felt strongly that the MLP fandom is more than just a bunch of people who like a TV show.  As a community, we should be thankful that something like this even occurred -- like the fandom itself, it was a happy accident in more ways than one.

I just wanted to get this fact out there. They used 3466 mhz Trident Z (B die) and hand tuned aggressive timings by ""The Stilt"" 

Using that they lowered RAM Latency to 60ns 

Intel at stock has around  54ns

If he 8700k runs on the same RAM amd same timings it gets to 45ns latency  but the gap ia still closer than stock to stock

The result: If both CPU's use the hand tuned RAM the difference in gaming (2700x vs 8700k) is 5% instead of the stock to stock 11%

Thats insane considering all other benefits Ryzen has like platform, price, cooling and especially workload leading performance

When I do manage to convince myself to go do *something* I usually can't think of anything that isn't too dicouraging to take m back to where I started. I can usually see these episodes coming when they do and I tell myself that if I had any sort of weapon against this kind of mood I should use it immediately, but nothing comes up.

We broke up because she thought that it looked like it was leading to marriage and she loves me but isn't in love. She says that she could see marrying me because she appreciates many qualities about me and I treat her well/we get along.

I found out last night that she has slept with more than 17 people in the last year, she stopped keeping count. I was her second, my first. 

Do women often feel the desire to break out of a relationship like this and just noncommittally sleep around for fun?  Why does she want this as opposed to a mutually fulfilling relationship?

1689,"I've have seen a lot about abortion today on Reddit and it has been on my mind as I am getting one tomorrow. Because of things I have read and discussions I have had recently I just want to get this off my chest.

When the doctor asked my boyfriend and I why we had made the decision to get an abortion, even though I knew she was asking me for my own good, I couldn't help but feel annoyed at the very question.

In July I had a copper coil (IUD) fitted. I thought about it a lot, and I thought it was the best thing I could do to ensure I didn't get pregnant. Because I didn't want to get pregnant. I got the coil with its' five year lifespan and I planned to rethink whether or not it was time for children either at the end of the five years, or I could decide to have it removed earlier.

Unfortunately my coil wasn't fitted properly, and I fell pregnant. So when - having heard this whole story - the doctor asked me why, I just wanted to say ""Because I decided I didn't want to have a baby when I got the coil. Just because it failed that hasn't made a new decision for me.""

But I knew that was unfair on her, so I just told her that we didn't want children at the moment, and she accepted that and was very helpful.

I read a thread on AskReddit which was full of stories of why people were unable to bring a child into the world and that is why they felt they had to have an abortion. And I just wanted to share my story about a couple who are technically able to but choose not to bring a child into the world. That we are in love, in a stable relationship, both with excellent careers, plenty of money, a good education and a desire to start a family one day. But not now. That's why we had decided to use contraception.

I know that some women get pregnant by accident and they suddenly want that child, and that's beautiful. In fact, it's how I was born. But that isn't how we feel about this unplanned pregnancy, which we did everything we could to prevent.

So I am very sad, and very scared, and have been feeling very sick even though I am only six weeks gone. But I know this is the right thing for us. And I'm looking forward to planning a pregnancy one day. And I am thankful that it isn't that I want a child and am unable to provide for one, but that I have decided to not have children at this moment in time.

Anyone going through a similar experience my heart goes out to you. And any woman who had an experience like this change her mind and made her want to bring a child into the world - congratulations. I hope that everything will work out for all of us.

Edit: a few people have asked why I am not considering adoption (and strangely all deleted their comments) so I thought I would add my response to the original post: The reason I am not going to create a life and bring a child into the world in order to have it adopted is that there are thousands, hundreds of thousands at least, of children in the world who don't have parents. What right do I have to create another one? The world is over-populated and there are already children who need parents right now. There is no shortage of children who need to be adopted.

**Second edit:** I'm leaving for the hospital in about an hour and felt so lucky to wake up to all of these insightful comments, helpful shared experiences, and wishes of love and support. My boyfriend and I just read through all of them and were so touched by the fact that so many people have taken the time to read our story and share their thoughts and experiences. I want to reply to all of you but need to get up and go out to the hospital now, but as soon as I can I will speak to you all. Thank you so much. And I hope I haven't scared women who have the IUD too much! I'm getting another one and hopefully this doctor will be a bit better at it."

My right arm is also in a 90 degree angle, but I am able to fold it to reach my face and feed myself. I am unable though to stretch my arms out. When I was younger, bones grew near the ribs locking them into place. As i grew older, it caused to me to get severe scoliosis. This is a progressive disease meaning that the older I get, the worse I will become. People with FOP get these things called flare-ups where our muscles will really swell up and the bone will grow, limiting movement until the body tells it to stop. I am currently having one in my hip and thigh and it extremely painful. My chances of not being able to walk are very slim. There is currently no cure or treatment as of February 15, 2013, but there is hope because a clinical trial will start later this year. There is still a struggle  and it could be years till I am able to receive the treatment.A student at my school is helping me raise awareness by doing various fundraising activities. On April 7th she is hosting a ‘Field Day’ for the student body, with all donations going to the International Fop Association for research.

I also have a taste for using lesser known musicians for my online teasers and DVDs to give my client fresh views and to stand out from every other wedding teasers and videos out there.  

Problem is I have trouble finding the style of music I want.  I have a handful of music I've looked for from Jamendo, and I've also used freemusic.org but I'm looking for something fairly specific so it's getting tougher to find what I want to use.

I am looking for something along the lines of an Acoustic Pop, to go with the video and try to tell a story.  If I have to pick a few well know artists to describe what I'm looking for it'd be along the lines of Ingrid Michaelson, or some of the Death Cab songs.  I recently found this couple group called Wild Child and they were pretty awesome.

I was wondering if anyone in this subreddit would know of a place where I can get royalty free music, anything with creative common licenses would be great.  I don't have a lot of money to spend, but I'd like to use different music for every client I get cause I think I have a great way to introducing artists to clients and they are generally geared towards the much popular side but most of them enjoy the type of music I put in my work.  

Also, for a general survey, how much do you think it's worth to use a piece of music for anywhere between 4 to 6 months online on my website, and to use it on a wedding DVD that will be copied maybe 5 times at the most?  I've used some general music for another DVD I packaged for a comedian with creative common licenses.  For about $25 USD I can put it on up to 1000 DVDs.

I am a big guy...BMI over 30 and I have really been thinking about running to lose weight... But I am suffer from large moobs..

I really wanted your honest thoughts on what you dedicated fellows see when you see a fat man running ....struggling...

Deep down - do you laugh at the person? Do you snicker? What is it that goes through your heads when you see such a situation?

Dont worry - if you do feel like the guy is a loser or any such thing - just be honest! It would help me - and certainly other big people know how to react (or how to strengthen the mind) before running

Thanks guys for your opinions (and honesty!)

Guys! Thank you! I mean there is absolutely no way I could have expected such a warm response and I hope that this post will help all those people peeking into this sub-reddit for the first time.

Thank you very much runners! You cannot believe how much anxiety exists within my mind (and I am sure in a number of 'big' people's minds - this goes a very long way in reducing that!

I want to tell each and every single one of you who replied to this post (and I appreciate the honesty most of all!) - Thank You! From a fellow human being - this really warms my heart!

Thanks again guys! I will definitely put on my trainers this coming Saturday and belt out a couple of kilometres.

If you see a big person running near you - please please definitely smile or give a thumbs up! "

My husband and I are really struggling financially lately and we need to get started on his US immigration stuff this month. I came back to Minnesota to work and save so that we could start this month and unfortunately, I have been pushing back the dates to go back to India and be with my husband. All because of finances. Well, last night I received an e-mail from a friend I don't even really keep up with all that much and they told me they are going to pay for most of our immigration needs.

I feel like crying. I don't want to be Filipino anymore. Law school feels like a futile joke at becoming something that could help our countrymen. Why am I still holding on to the hope that our people can be better? Can become smarter and stronger? I want to die at how stupid, naive and gullible people can be.

So I thought to myself, with the beginning of Season 3, why not try an experiment on those lines of thought.

This is what I did: saved some money for a new streaming PC, set myself a strict schedule for playing league and stopped college for a period of one year in order to do this.

I call it Project Challenger and I will be starting it today at 11:00AM (GMT). http://www.twitch.tv/woundarbloodcleave

At the moment I'm not high rated, just your average joe trying to succeed at what he loves most. I mostly play jungle ... and mostly suck at the rest of the roles xD. I hope this will make at least an entertaining story to tell at the end of Season 3. So let the experiment begin!

1765,"if you beleive in abiogenesis in addition to determinism and non free will in addition to matter being blind and dumb, then it makes sense to assume that only real difference between a living being and a non livining rock is the complexity of their molecular structure and pattern formation. all decision making and reasoning made by humans does not create a distinction between non living material other than it being a more complex molecular and chemical reaction in context with outside variables(that is of course if you dont believe in free will).

so if biology is merely the complexification of molecular pattern, how do you figure consciousness and self awareness into this paradigm. Is consciousness itself a pattern, and if so what makes a pattern aware of its own existance.

also, do you guys propose quantum physics has anything to do with it?"

1779,"My buddy and I were talking and he told me that Star Trek made him the person he is today (which is funny to me cause he's a death metal loving, ex-Catholic, atheist Linux lover) and it got me thinking about what shows had a huge impact on me. 

For me it has to be Northern Exposure. I watched every episode when I was a teen and had them on tape for years. I can remember specific lines from that show that really helped shape my outlook on things. For example, there was a line where Chris Stevens said, ""if it's crawlin' on the wall and not on your arm-- let it be man."" 
That has been with me since I was like 13 years old and I still go by that when it comes to not just insects but life in general. If it's not affecting me, then let it be man.

1785,"Religion has long been associated with finding meaning in life, and so as an atheist it might not be surprising to most that I feel a lack of it in my day to day existence. But a religious life is not necessarily one with meaning, just as an atheist one is not necessarily without it. Nevertheless I believe that religion is a good source for a framework to develop a meaningful life.  
  
The first way I tried to adapt religious activities to my atheist life was through prayer:  
  
I understand the appeal of prayer to the religious -- it's a chance to communicate with a higher power, to ask for help, offer thanks and find support and direction. How it is relevant to an atheist is not immediately clear, however, and it took me a while to warm up to the prospect of using something like prayers as part of my search for meaning.  
  
I should mention that although I don't believe in a god of any kind and see a lot that is wrong with religion both now and in the past, I do have a respect for certain elements of world religions and for the truly pious who dedicate their lives to them. So I began my experiment with prayer by memorizing the [23^rd Psalm](http://www.rwf2000.com/23pslm.htm). I was under no illusion that I was communicating with anything outside myself when I recited it to myself, but I thought it would be worth trying out to see if it had the similar comforting effect on me that it has had for Jews and Christians. I found it to be a beautiful piece of writing, and it did take my thoughts away from whatever was bothering me at the moment for the time it took to recite it, but other than that it did nothing.  
  
I next tried to more or less create my own prayers by selecting lines from the Dhammapada (a Buddhist text) and the Bagavad Gita (from the Hindu epic the Mahabharata). I made a point of choosing lines that were secular and applied to my particular needs. I then framed them into a couple short works, adding some lines of my own, and memorized them. I recited them to myself everyday as I walked to my classes as a way to remind myself of my goals, direction and ideals. This was much more successful than my experiment with the 23^rd Psalm, and I think it really did help motivate me through my most recent semester and make my day to day activities feel somewhat more meaningful as I could see them as part of a greater purpose. I plan to continue with this sort of ""prayer"" as part of my life, as well as other ""religious"" activities that I have converted for use in a secular life. Atheists just might have a lot to learn from the better elements of religion, whatever we think of any specific religious values or beliefs.  
  
What are your thoughts?"
1786,"I am near the end of writing my first novel and a character I had intended to introduce at the end was a God-like entity that isn't God exactly. The main character and this character speak about matters that concern them both, and I'm trying to my hardest for the latter not to sound like it has a god-complex. But no matter how many times I deconstruct it's dialogue between it and the protagonist, it comes off as sounding like the conventional God character. Also for clarity, the main character is a man in his thirties and it's his first encounter with this being. "
1787,"Since I have finished my gcses, I've gotten really distant from my friends. I expected this to happen but not so suddenly. We are hardly talking, no one wants to meet up and we are having arguments way more often. People I have known for a decade are now not on speaking terms with me. I know that I'll make more friends at sixth form but I didn't really want to lose my existing friends so quickly. I thought we had built something really great together and I was surprised people abandoned it so quickly. I really hope that someone else is experiencing this and I'm not just a dick.

I now train harder and workout better than ever because of Bakki the Grappler. The World God Only Knows has made me start playing and finishing my games more efficiently (I tried God Mode, to difficult). I also study harder thanks to many cliche anime situations that are held in high school. So what anime did you guys watch that made you try something new or made you better?

EDIT: Wow this really took off! I'll make sure I take the time read all of your responses.

1796,"Since season 4 is just round the corner and it may be the last season, how would you like the relationship pairings to end? Here is a quick round-up of the way things could go.  


    **Jeff and Britta**

*Pros*  
* They were the original pairing! Getting them together would sure bring the show full circle and create some nostalgia.  
*lots of similarities: Both have a sarcastic sense of humour, are naturally sceptical etc.  
*Chemistry: They have history and good chemistry. It feels like they both have unfinished business.
 
*Cons*  
*Troy: he certainly seems to have come in and taken Britta's heart, which could be a problem for writers to untie without destroying the group.  
* Incompatibility: Although similar, Jeff and Britta argue the whole time. It doesn't exactly make you want the relationship to happen.  
*Improving personalities: neither betters the other in any way. they don't bring out the best in each other. In fact, it's the opposite.  

    **Jeff and Annie**

*Pros*  
*They are adorable! They share some very touching moments, particularly in season 3.  
*Personality improvements: Jeff helps Annie to relax and Annie helps Jeff to care more for others. The opposite as with Jeff and Britta.  
*Chemistry: they have great sexual and personal chemistry which makes their cute moments all the more touching.  

*Cons*  
*The age gap: some may find the fictional age gap a bit too excessive and therefore slightly creepy on Jeff's part.  
*The original pairing: It breaks the original relationship between Jeff and Britta, which may leave some of the more dedicated viewers unhappy.  
*Too different? There is a suggestion that they differ just too much to actual be feasible as long-term relationship material.     

So, there it is, the two most likely relationship endings in my opinion. I would love to hear your input!

1804,"Since everybody wants it, I'll post what I recall about the session of F.A.T.A.L. we played.  It's been years so my memory is (thankfully) pretty fuzzy but here goes.

First, everyone showed up EXCEPT Jordon-who's-fault-this-whole-thing-was.  After phoning him up we learned that he'd been called in to work and would be late, but he told us it was okay and to just start without him.  Bastard.  So we started, and right from the get-go it was horrible.  There are primary stats in F.A.T.A.L., each of which is the average of some sub-stats, five I think.  Each sub stat is generated by rolling (4d100/2)-1.  Yep.  I sure hope you love doing averages in your head because you have to about 100 times to make a F.A.T.A.L. character.  Anyway you generate all of these substats by doing the above roll a LOT (even now that equation is seared into my memory, years later) and then you average each set of sub-stats to get each main stat.  Imagine what the room was like trying to get 10 people who'd never played this game to roll that many dice and do that much math in their heads or longhand.  It was chaos.  Yes we could have used calculators but I DID NOT ALLOW IT.  If I had to GM this pig they could do the fucking math the hard way.  Anyway that took about a fucking hour, mostly because I had to keep explaining it to them.  Then Jordan showed up.

He breezed in like it was no problem and had a hearty laugh at our expense, apologized for being so late, and told us to just go ahead and finish up without him.  ""Oh no.  No you sit your fucking ass down and catch up with us you greasy shithumper.  This whole thing is because of YOU!!"" We all said with our eyes (and some of us said it with our mouths too) while we fetched pencils and a blank sheet.  Now that we'd all done it, it went pretty well and after about 15 minutes he was all caught up.  Poor bastard.

Now came the ""skill modifiers"".  You have to look up each stat and find the skill modifier for skills keyed off of that stat.  They're mostly the same but the table is reprinted separately for each ability.  Seriously, there's like 40 pages of nearly identical tables after the stats section for these skill modifiers.  Also each entry on the table has a ""description"" that I think you're supposed to write down,  I don't remember.  I do remember that one of the descriptors for one of the dex-like stats was ""physical movement precision"" and it was all in fractions of an inch.  Retarded.  Some of that stats of course have multiple modifiers like ""maximum speech rate"" which is based off your enunciation stat which is naturally vitally important for casters.  Blerf. One of the characters' had for his language modifier ""undismayed"".  Also there is a rule for ""retard strength"" if a character's intelligence is below 70, so there's that.  (Of course nobody in my group qualified for said retard strength because the stats are so averaged, but it says a lot about the game that it's there, and that it's called ""retard strength.)

About now you're probably thinking ""this isn't so bad, sure the math is overly complex and the bizarre prediliction for averages will result in nearly-identical stats for most characters but it isn't all *horrible* or anything. You're right, at this point it isn't too bad... Leave now.  Seriously.  Stop reading this thread and go to /r/aww for a  while and never  come back.  You'll be better off for the rest of your life if you do, I'm not kidding.

Okay you chose poorly.   So next everybody chose their gender and race.   Under gender there's a whole bit where he basically recapitulates Aristotle's opinions on the differences between the sexes, and gives you modifiers to the stats based on them.  It's pretty sexist but not nearly as bad as you would expect based on the stuff you'll be putting on your character sheet in a few minutes so I gotta give props.  Now you just pick your race and apply the racial modifiers to your stats and you're done with statsOHWAITNOTREALLY!  Now a bunch of your secondary stats have changed haven't they? Guess what that means!  You get to re-average everything to re-derive your primary stats now, isn't that awesome!  Isn't it great that we get to do that all over again?  Interestingly enough there's a paragraph where the author apologizes for using the term ""race"" as that might be deemed inappropriate.  Bear in mind in a little bit you'll be generating the circumference of your asshole to determine how much dong it takes you rape you to death, so being concerned about the term ""race"" is... odd.  Anyway we did all of this without too much difficulty, just some groaning about having to re-derive all 20 (or whatever) stats.  Each race also has a few skill modifiers to jot down and some of them have random traits or special powers.  After the races were all chosen everyone had to record their races various hatreds for the other members of the group based on the race-hate table.  I also suggested that if their character had a particularly high racial hatred for another character's race they could note some of the racial slurs in the helpful list the game includes (One of which is ""stovepiper"" based on the thick dicks one of the races has, I forget which.)

The next chapter was called ""Body"" and is just page after page of tables to determine height, weight, hair color, all that bullshit.  It took us quite a while because it's needlessly detailed and largely nonsensical.  There are tables for everything.  I do remember we had a good laugh at the best feature/worst feature roll.  I think we had a Dwarf with really nice hair but whose worst feature was ""crotch"" so we ruled he was just really really hairy *everywhere*.  Good times.  There's also some  really critical shit in this chapter determined by single die rolls.  for example you roll percentile on the vision quality table at one point and if you roll low you're mostly blind and suck at hitting stuff. One of the players had already decided due to his stats to be mostly ranged but it turned out he couldn't see very well.  Sucked to be that guy.  

Then we hit the stuff F.A.T.A.L. is famous for.

Partway through the body chapter you run into the section about sexual characteristics.  They were just following along and and I said ""okay, now everybody roll for areaola diameter"".  You could have heard a pin drop for about 2 seconds and then laughter and chaos.   Once I got them calmed down they all rolled for that (modified by race of course) then areaola color and hue, then cup size and nipple *length*.  It was hilarious and deeply disturbing at the same time.  The results were hilarious, we were going around the table rolling for each thing and just cracking up laughing at every roll.   We had a troll with enourmous nipples and areaolas like appetizer plates but AA cup breasts.  One guy had a tongue that could touch the top of his nose.  Yes TOP, not tip.  He could almost lick his own eyebrows. Then there's vaginal circumference and depth, which is based on height if I recall correctly with a random percentage added on and then modified by race.  There are even modifiers to VCP based on whether the character is a mother, a nymphmaniac, or a slut.  FYI The modifier to vaginal circumference for being a slut is larger than the one for having given birth, ladies take note.  There's a similar table for ACP (anal circumference, potential) and that was fun for all because everybody has an anus, not everybody has a vagina.  We did some rough comparison and decided that one of the characters could possibly fit another completely inside their anus.  An immediate plan was hatched in case the larger player was ever sent to jail to smuggle the other one inside the larger's anus.  This is the kind of discussion you have while playing this game.  There's even a ""hymen penetration"" or ""hymen resistance"" table, I can't recall the exact name thank god.  There's a bunch of shit about menstruation and fertility rates and such.  Then we (mostly male players) got to the part we'd been waiting for: dicks. EDIT: shit, I forgot to mention this: on vaginal circumference there is a handy ""reference"" column that compares the various vagina size classes to the number of same-species fingers and/or fists that can be inserted therein.  Wow.

1806,"Sorry this is so long, the TL;DR is: Man raped by another man, met girl who helped him recover, married her, scared he will hurt her and unborn child.

I don't want to go into too many details because enough people in my life know bits and pieces about my situation and I would like to remain anonymous.  Also, in the same vein, I will apologize up front for the throwaway account. So you can visualize, I am a mid-20's white male.

Growing up I was not very sexual. I don't think it was because I wasn't interested but I was just so busy with everything going on in my life that the free time usually required for a kid to get away and get his rocks off was not there for me.  I had to have a job from the age of 13, including when I was in school, and on top of that I was an active athlete, a useful tool for avoiding the trappings of growing up in an urban neighborhood many people are scared to visit.  I didn't have many friends outside of my athletics and of the few friends I had that were girls I knew them so long that I couldn't imagine putting their friendship at risk by entering into a BF/GF relationship with them.  Ok, maybe I did imagine and did think about it a lot, but I never acted on it.

I had saved up enough money on the side after working and helping the family to travel, something that has always been a dream/passion of mine, so the fall after graduating HS I decided to defer college for a year and travel through Africa, the Middle East, and Europe.  I left home in August.  In October I was walking through a club district late at night and was attacked from behind by a man with a knife.  He pulled me into a nearby ally behind a dumpster before I could react. I sort of panicked and before I could get out my wallet my pants were down.  The rest is a blur and makes me nauseas to think about but I ended up on the ground, pants down to my knees, and some blood coming out of my extremely sore anus.  Strangely he left my phone and wallet in my pocket and never said a word to me.  Not sure what to do I called the embassy who told me to go to a hospital and there I was met by police and a representative from the embassy who was there to make sure I didn't say the wrong thing because sodomy is illegal where I was.  

I didn't leave my room for two weeks except to eat.  After the first day I didn't even shower.  I was a fucking mess in a random country with no real friends or family to help out.  My mother wanted me to come home but I wouldn't budge.  I was renting a room from some local students who did not know what was going on, only that I was very disturbed and that I was not the person they had met when I first met them.  Finally one of them convinced me to leave the apartment and go out with them, there was a small dinner party they were attending and they wanted me to come.  I begrudgingly went (I took a shower and such first) and I was feeling a little better.  There was only one other American at the party, a girl my age who was volunteering as an English teacher at a school for abandoned teens.  For some reason these kids weren't in an orphanage, they kept their own residence and some even had younger siblings to look after, so we had some interesting conversation.  Sorry for the tangent.  Anyways, being my first time eating a real meal in a long time, I started feeling very good about myself, and ended up talking confidently with this girl all night.  She ended up staying in my room that night but nothing happened other than us falling asleep spooning.

The next morning reality hit me. She was a nice girl and all but I didn't want to drag anyone into my shit storm life.  At this point I had cancelled the rest of my trip and decided to stay in the country until I was no longer needed by the police and then bolt.  In a rare state of openness I told her everything that had happened that morning.  She was obviously horrified and when I told her that I didn't want her to be dragged down by me she wouldn't have any of it.  Looking back it was obviously very selfish of me to even mention it to her and give her that burden to hold on her shoulders.  We started seeing each other daily and she even accompanied me to all of my followup doctor visits (std checks, etc) and meetings with the police/prosecutors.  We spent a lot of time together and when my sublease was up I ended up moving into her apartment. I told myself I was staying in order to see the prosecution against my attacker take place and assist as a witness but I know it was also because I had taken a real liking to her. The night I moved in I lost my virginity, well lost my consensual and m/f virginity.  we lived there (on her dime) through the winter and spring and had a great time.  We cried together a lot (she had just lost her dad) and laughed a lot.  Oh, and we had sex. A lot.  A normal day had us having sex at least 3 times a day.  We used a condom for the first month but once I got negative results from all of the STD tests we stopped using protection as she was on the pill.

After her stint as a teacher was up it was time for us both to fly back to our respective homes, me to college for the summer semester and her back to her mom's.  We were over 1,500 miles away so we had to make a decision.  We went from sex all the time to none at all. I don't know what she did but I was masturbating a lot.  She gave me enough... material to keep me busy between visits but it wasn't enough.  After the summer semester was over I left the dorms even though they were covered by my scholarship and moved in with her, again on her (or her family's) dime.  She wasn't going to school but her mom just wanted her to be happy I guess.  We lived basically as a married couple through my time in college and got married as soon as I graduated.  That was two years ago and now my wife is pregnant with our first child.

After all that, finally here is my confession.  After a while things slowed down sexually to a more normal rate.  The problem is that I was a little obsessed.  I would have to have an orgasm at least once a day so if she wasn't game I would just masturbate. She doesn't really care when I do but I am concerned over what I am masturbating to.  I am obsessed with middle school and high school love stories that end in one or both losing their virginity.  Sure I can get off to run of the mill porn but I am constantly attracted to young love stories.  I have never watched underage porn but I have visualized it in my head and have even fantasized about a 15 year old me having sex and taking the virginity of my wife's 15 year old sister.  I have even gotten off to brother/sister 'exploration' stories.  I don't think I am attracted to children but I am attracted to the experience of learning about sex in the teenage years. I guess that is the best way to put it.  I am still very attracted to my wife and she does not have the features of a teenager.  I worry that I will have bad thoughts about my child when he/she is a teenager.  I worry that I will make my wife feel bad because she is unable to satisfy me sexually.  Even before she got pregnant we were only having sex once a week max, now it is even less frequent.  I still love her with all my heart and don't want to do anything to hurt her.

A big part of me wants to just disappear.  Not die but to just go away.  I often think about leaving everyone in my life behind so that I don't have anyone to drag down.

Oh, and for those who are wondering, yes my rapist was convicted and sentenced to 10 years which was actually extended to 20 due to something he did while in prison.

I am sure there are things here that don't make sense or are missing, I just put down things as they came to me and deleted and started over many times and might have left something out, so feel free to ask.  I will answer anything as long as it doesn't reveal my identity."
1807,"Hey guys, I've been lurking /r/JamesBond for a while and love it here. I was going through some of my old stuff and came across an old novel. ""Silverfin"". It is the first book of a novel series called ""Young Bond"".

It isn't written by Ian Flemming, it's by a writer named Charlie Higson.

It is teen fiction, while it's nothing at all like the James Bond we all know from Ian Flemming and the movies, it's still pretty damn good.

This series creates a rich and immersive background story to Bond. What drives him, and where he comes from.

[Pictures](http://imgur.com/a/4DKo9)  
Now to the fun stuff, it's basically just copy pasta from the fittit FAQ, because that shit is golden, son!  
**Stats**  
5'11 290lbs - 6'0 183lbs. (I grew an inch!)  
**Diet**  
I simply counted calories, I started with a thousand calorie deficit for the first few months and reduced the extremity of the deficit as I went along gradually. I'm currently still running a 500 calorie deficit as I have about 20lbs roughly before I'm around 12% body fat. (Currently sitting around 19-20%). The biggest part on not giving up with my cut was patience. I lost weight pretty quickly (100lbs in about 9 months) but it still took me a long time to notice differences. The biggest key to trumping that fact was realizing at no matter what weight I was I was happy with my body. Happy but not content. I was just as happy with my face and proud of myself at 250lbs as I am now at 180lbs. I implemented cheat meals every Friday when I would throw down with the bro's and ate what ever I want within reason, as that falls in line with what a lot of people say here. My progress would have been faster if I had not done this but it is not as certain that I would have succeeded if I had not treated myself from time to time. I never punished myself for the days I slipped up as well, I'm human, you're human, we're all human and we make mistakes the key is not scolding yourself every time you make a mistake, and instead improve from the ones you make.  
**Exercise**  
For the first few weeks I began with easy cardio, slow long walks every night with my mother (Who has also lost 60lbs, GO MOM!) and then slowly started taking up more difficult things like running and skipping rope. I started out not being able to jump rope for a minute straight and wanting to vomit after running a quarter of a mile. I have since ran a 30 minute 5k for my local humane shelter. I have sort of laid off the cardio since then though, I just do a mile on all my lift days at varying intensities depending at what I'm ""feeling"". Which brings me to my next subject, LIFTING! Don't skip out on this, I did for a very long time and only since I have begun to lift 'this heavy-ass weight' have I begun to really see vast differences in myself in my body. AND THAT IS WHILE LIFTING ON A DEFICIT AS WELL. Thank the gods for noob gains. I hurt my rotator cuff pushing myself, so my upper body lifts are still pretty meager for 3 months worth of progress, just gotta suck it up and keep grinding! I started with Starting Strength but have since switched to GreySkull LP, because of the longer rest periods between each compound while still utilizing my noob gains.   
**3 months lifting stats**  
Squat 115lbs -- 185lbs  
Deadlift 135lbs -- 255lbs  
Bench Press 75lbs -- 130lbs  
OHP 60lbs -- 85lbs (Dem rotator cuff :/)  
Pendlay Rows 105lbs -- 135lbs

Whats the prize?
25 bucks (at least) worth of movies off your wish list, that offend me by the fact YOU DON'T OWN THEM!!!

Horror, Sci Fi, Fantasy, Foreign Films, Violent movies, and B Movies are prefered, sad depresssing endings where you feel really crappy after watching it and just want to curl up in bed in the fetal position are also awesome. 

This Contest will end March 15th, so happy hunting. Also, put down multiple movies since well well like I said I own 9-Zombies of Mass Destruction.

1812,"I started working out last september after my father was diagnosed with Cardiomyopathy. Since he has that and diabetes, i made the decision to start a healthy lifestyle while I can. I don't wanna be 40 and plagued with health problems and I don't think my dad wants that, either. 

[This was me back when I was at my heaviest in late 2011](http://i.imgur.com/4tyr1.jpg), I think I weighed around 210 pounds at the time. 

I cut out soda and junk food from my diet, I started intermittent fasting, and lifted weights 3 times a week and walked at least a mile everyday. 

[This is me now at 154 pounds](http://i.imgur.com/RoCeEv5.jpg). I still have a bit of progress to make before I can start bulking up but I'm glad I've made some progress.

Sucks being the short guy in the family, I didn't knew how much weight I was putting on until I started losing it, didn't knew I had to go this far just to burn off some bellyfat. I still have some stubborn areas to burn off still! "

He didn't explain what happened or if he would continue nofap, but it sort of hurt. If someone can go two and a half years without fapping, how the hell am I supposed to make it? I want to quit forever because I am addicted, but now I'm worried."

1826,"I live in a city that is huge on football (soccer), over here in England you literally walk down any street, into any pub or into any social place, you will see people wearing football shirts, flaunting their colours and affiliations for any and all to see. Now I am a huge Liverpool fan, for 20 years I've followed them through thick and thin, been to more games than I can remember and spent fortunes on affiliated clothes and memorabilia. But earlier this year I made two purchases that ranked above any of those, a mouse mat and a hoodie. Specifically, a Dignitas hoodie, and a mouse mat brandishing the signature of Scarra. Now I've followed Dig a long time, since before LoL, I was a huge dig fan years back when Counter-strike was king of E-sports and then when I got into LoL and they picked up Rock Solid, I never looked back. 

Now I don't expect all of you to have as strong of affiliation as me, but I urge you all to follow me and promote this scene, this game, this sport, simply by making some kind of contribution to show your colours.

It doesn't matter if ur Dig, TSM, Curse, CLG or now even Evil Geniuses, let's all get behind a team and show everyone that we are behind them and this sport. For too long the whole idea of gamers and gaming has been plagued with the twisted vision of a fat ugly teen living through world of warcraft. I mean look at ocelote and Snoopeh for example, two young, fit handsome guys, these are the people that can change that image, but only if we help promote it and the sport. Riot can only do so much, so now it's our turn.

So, if you're following a team, you have one month to do whatever you can to get behind them, it doesn't have to be a £50 tshirt or jacket, it can be as little as a TSM wristband for £3. But I'd love to think this time next year, that I could walk into a busy pub and even just see one other person wearing a League shirt. This is a big year for LoL as it pretty much single handedly carries e-sports to a new level, and I'd hope we  can all do as much as possible to help it succeed.

**TL:DR** This is a huge year for e-sports, now lets show that gamers arn't just basement dwellers who would be to embarrassed to admit they are e-sports fans, but embrace it and promote it to anyone and everyone.**

I've been doing some reading and I'm seeing that evangelicals are doing a very successful job harvesting souls in underdeveloped countries like India and in bigger continents like Africa. I am not a fan of religion, but I'm especially not a fan of evangelical christianity. 

Does anybody here have any insight into their way of thought and how to counter and potentially stop it? I even personally know some people who have made it their life mission to go on this ""holy job"".

1828,"I recently listened to a [really excellent episode](http://www.radiolab.org/story/update-crispr/) of the podcast Radiolab that discusses CRISPR, a technique for editing genes.  

The thing that made the episode so interesting is that this one was basically an update of and update of an original episode that aired some years ago.  

I encourage everyone to listen, but the short version is that recent developments in a technique called ""gene drive"" have opened the theoretical door for self-perpetuating gene editing, and the potential for small groups or even individuals to modify genes in embryos - genes which may then alter entire populations over generations, with or without human control or consent.

It can be a love story of sorts, one of the classics, a philosophical book, I don't care, just as long as it can make me feel something. I just ask that it's not something that's constantly working toward a sickly-sweet ""happy ending"" or anything like that... I want something real. Thanks in advance for any help you can provide.

EDIT: As far as genres I've tended to favor, when I am reading I generally find myself reading literary fiction -- DFW, Pynchon -- and classics like Vonnegut, Faulkner, etc. I haven't yet finished a book of his, but I love the way Cormac McCarthy writes.

Does it make more sense to include these new species under ""humanity"" and have ""mankind"" refer to just humans, or vice-versa?  The other way seems better on the basis of wording (humanity equals humans), but given the subreddit, having it as ""humanity equals all of us"" feels like a good choice too.

1845,"Hello fellow commanders, I'm just going to be sharing some pictures of a strange protuberance I found while leaving Parenago 2149. I'd never seen terrain form like this in game so I thought I'd share it with you guys and see what you think.

http://imgur.com/a/4KHOW

Location is:
Parenago 2149 B 2 F (it is orbiting the Neutron Star in the system)

Co-ordinates to find it are:
31.5368
-52.1865

Word of warning: the Spirograph Nebula area is locked down almost everywhere (it essentially didn't exist for either me or the navigation computer as it wasn't letting me pass through. Seems like FDev just want to lock up basically everywhere around Orion which sucks). It is probably best to just avoid being efficient and just B-Line for Parenago 2149. Safe travels!)."

1849,"So I picked up EVE last week, once again determined to find that sandbox magic that we had all read about but that seems miles of spreadsheets and obscure terms away when you undock for that first time. I had from previous trials already determined that missions were too much kill-10-rats-in-space for me and mining... well, mining made NPC missions look like dynamic wonders of emergent gameplay. Still, I didn't want to jump headlong into PvP without at least some money-making skills behind me, so I chose exploration. 

Now exploration is tough at first because scanning isn't easy to learn or very fast for a new character, and many sites are often not the ones you are looking for, and even when you do find the correct site they sometimes have little of value. And then you hit the jackpot. I tripled my net worth twice, first with a 6 and then a 24 million find and from there on I was hooked.

Later, I had this idea that if I was finding all of this stuff close to Jita, space treasure would be even better in some dead-end, god-forsaken lowsec backwater where even the pirates got bored. I bought my first industrial hauler and packed it full of exploration frigates, combat frigates, drones, hotdogs and other essentials for an interstellar camping trip. Having no idea about the political geography of eve, I dove into the fractal maze of stars until I found a chain of systems that looked suitably abandoned, and set the autopilot on my lumbering space-truck.

True enough, my first day of prospecting netted a 44m site. As I excitedly analyzed the broken ships and bagged the cargo, Mr. Pirate warps in. Mr. Pirate is in [this](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090915064606/eve/images/b/b3/Harbinger512.jpg), I am in [this.] (http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/w/images/thumb/f/f6/Imicus.jpg/256px-Imicus.jpg) I proceed to shit myself and freeze up remembering all those articles about the unforgiving universe of EVE. I had greedily ventured into lowsec and now I was going to pay the prize, was my thinking as the first salvo blew off half my shields. The jolt must have shocked me into action because I decided to make a run for it, aimed for the opposite side and turned on my afterburner, praying for the next shot to miss. Now it's true that as a new player, you don't stand a chance against a 100m ship that takes weeks to learn how to fly. But Battlecruisers, as I discovered, are slow. 

Soon I was outside of warp scrambler range and hauling ass to my depo giggling like a madman. I had been so close to losing the biggest catch of my EVE life, yet I had survived! I was a survivor! Mr. Pirate struck up a conversation on chat and congratulated me on my getaway. Turns out he frequented the same area both exploring and taking shots of opportunity. Now Mr. Pirate was very friendly, even helping me clear out some tough sites in lowsec without blowing me up, a risk I was acknowledging when I asked him to fleet with me.

Today, my new frenemy had found 4 juicy magnetometric sites in a system, but had not equipped the scientific equipment to scan them, so he asked me to join him, scavenging the sites while he fought off their defenders. After one hour I had gathered 15m in salvage and some tier 2 blueprints worth a total of 100m for some rather easy work. My new buddy warps off to station to ""reload his shields"" and when he comes back I ask him how he wants to split. His response comes as his ship locks on to mine and scrambles my warp drive. 

""*Let this be a lesson: Hand over the blueprints and you'll get away unharmed.*""

This brought me some pause. This time he was only a few thousand meters away from me and I was flying a much bigger and slower [Vexor](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/w/images/thumb/d/d9/Vexor.jpg/256px-Vexor.jpg). Not having experienced much PvP I had no idea what my chances of survival were. If he had fitted a short-range warp scrambler my microwarp drive was dead and I was stuck. If he had fitted a long-range warp disruptor I had a chance to get out of range of his larger and (hopefully) slower ship before his lasers tore me apart.

Trapped, I made the only rational decision: Ignorant of my chances of escape, I had to assume they were 50/50. My ship was worth some 10m. My cargo was worth a 100. I was going to make a run for it. I engaged the microwarp drive and felt a surge of adrenaline as my ship started accelerating. I was still within disruptor range, but I was gaining distance fast and wasn't taking any hits. I had the luck to be sitting exactly between him and a distant space station, so all I had to do was roar ahead until I exited his 24-km jamming distance and I was free. Still no hits, I had no idea if he had utterly not expected me to run or if he was actually firing but missing. The little icon at the bottom of my HUD faded, and I warped. Free! Free with a more money in my cargo hold than I had in my bank account, all of it snatched from the claws of death!

I am hooked.

1858,"**Assuming the game is native resolution of whatever screen you are using, what visual factors are your most important?** (Visual factors = anything seen through the eye about the game).

To me:

(1). Pleasing Visual Style

Mirrors Edge, Wind Waker, Dishonored and even Half Life 2 have a uniform aesthetic, which I think vastly improves their timelessness in the visual sense.


(2). 59+ FPS

I think FPS makes a game feel more ""real"" than polygons do. Maybe it's the responsiveness, maybe it's the similarity in FPS to news programming in the anologue era, but a high FPS really pulls me into a game world.

(3). Ultra Smooth, Not Sharpened, Anti Aliasing

I honestly can't stand jaggies (excluding pixel art) because I am reminded that these are computer created objects in a 3D space. I prefer the much more organic feeling to having everything blended together a little more.

I hate sharpening functions with AA because it ultimately ruins the reason I like the effect so much.

1874,"He was rambling about Book of Mormon and how it uplifts his Spirit and how he reads it every day. He said that the teachings in Book of Mormon make his life easier and he is thankful to Joseph Smith for bringing it forth to the world.

I asked him what the teachings of the Book of Mormon are and to give me an example how following the teachings of Book of Mormon made his life easier.

He went silent and said ""umm"" couple of times before my phone rang and saved him from answering. I am still waiting for the answer ...

1875,"This is just my own personal story, obviously everyone will slightly vary. 

I make 12k a year from working 20 hours a week at $11.50 an hour. I also get $470/month from DCFS because I got taken from my parents and I'm in college, so that helps a lot too. 

My boyfriend pays half of our rent/utilities/food/pet care. So, we each pay $680 for our basic joint living expenses.

Our food budget is $200/month. We get by with this very easily. We only shop at local grocery stores, and I'm a vegan so that cuts down A LOT on our bill (I noticed even when buying him only the cheapest meat, the meat takes up 1/3 of our bill.)

Our rent is $780/month for a one bedroom, but that comes with free gas and water. Can't really cut corners there because where we live isn't that great already. Any cheaper and I'm back in the ghetto.

I pay $80 in gas every month, and another $80 for car insurance. Car is paid off (97 camry)

Every pay check I put 3% in my 401k and 20% in savings. I've built up a good little chunk there by tossing any extra bits of cash I have into savings, which came in handy when that 97 Camry had to have $800 worth of repairs done last week.

How I save money?

I feel like we get by a lot easier than most mostly because of two things.

1. Our grocery budget is low because we know how to cook and don't have expensive tastes.

2. We're massive nerds that get anxiety from going out too much. There are so many free hobbies to have, no point in spending loads of cash at the bar. 

I'm currently in college, so even though my loans are in deferment I'm still paying $25/month, just so the interest doesn't compound and so that it does take away that little bit of principle.

1906,"This has bugged me a lot ever since the series introduced David (and to an extent Weyland Corporation) and his idea of how Xenos are superior or some kind of matchless specimen, Ash even calls it the perfect organism and the idea of ""perfection"" itself. Because they aren't. In the first movie Ripley outlives it. In the second film the marines kill them in hordes. Basically, at the end of every encounter with the Xenos, they perish and the human gets to live.

And it's not like David didn't witness it himself right? In Covenant he watched the crew dispose of the Xenomorph. 

How is the Xenomorph a perfect organism when IT dies everytime? Humans are superior in intelligence and survivability, purely on what the events of the films have portrayed, so why is this false idea pushed by Weyland Corp that these Xenos are on some other level of superiority? Is it just bullshit used to justify the company's weaponization of these creatures? "

He's still very introverted of course, so many times I just go out on my own with my friends and that's just how it is -- but it seems to work for us as long as I make some time for us, too.

**TL;DR: Counseling, time, reorganizing priorities, and working on support systems has worked.**"

Really, who sent me this book? I just put it up on my wishlist after seeing someone else receiving one and a week later, *boom*, found one in my mailbox. Now, I'd love to say an owl delivered it, but I know it was one of you lovely people (also, Muggles haven't yet integrated the USPS with Owl Post, so there's that).

I want to send you something as a way of a proper thank-you since I spent all of late last night flipping through all the delicious recipes and drooling about it. I'll even let you choose what you want (non-perishable choices, of course) if you have a preference. 

Don't leave me hanging!"
1922,"Hey everyone,

I know that the IPL Rant thread was a good wake-up call for myself, Josh, and Ryan. Not about the casting stuff (critique me as much as possible it makes me into a better caster) but the scheduling and other issues that you guys have.

If you guys don't know my background I come from console shooters like Call of Duty and Halo. Those two games have become dependent on what MLG does and it's unfortunate but that's the stranglehold they have on those communities. Throughout all of 2012 I spent my time showing the CoD community the means to be independent. I casted tournaments all around the country for different tournaments and supported the game through various means of social media. I never gave up on the game.

I won't give up on ShootMania.

What I need from you guys is more transparency. If we're doing something wrong, tell me. I have no ego and no desire to see this game fail. I see the content being made by Greggo and the vVv Gaming team and I also see how Clock is so passionate about pushing the community forward and if they can do it then we all can. It's guys like Indredd and Winters who inspire me to approach this with the community in mind like my CoD days.

So now the question is: HOW?

First, it's going to start with community building. We have a great platform with Reddit that we can use to spread the awareness of ShootMania. Let's continue to take advantage of this and build this community. When I first found this subreddit it had 600 people subscribed now it's at 730+. Let's get this to 800 at IPL6!

Second, If there are community events being made please let us know. We'll do our best to promote it through out channels. I'm sure the guys at Nadeo/Ubisoft would like that.

I'm going to draft up some ideas when I get back to the office on how we can do more community based programs and continue to spread awareness.

One last thing...

STREAM! 

You don't know how important that is to the development of this game. IPL should not be the ONLY stream on for ShootMania 80% of the time.

Let's grow this thing together and if you have any concerns or want to just talk to me my email is amendez@ign.com

Peace."

1936,"One of my favourite sub genres is the horror or techno thriller novel when protagonists are menaced by vicious creatures, but I think one of the hardest tasks a writer faces is creating an original and scary monster.

Frequently we see either the usual mainstays (vampires, zombies, werewolves and ghosts). Or monsters which are closely inspired by previous popular creations - Jurassic Park- dinosaurs, The Thing-shapeshifting aliens, Jaws/MEG- oversized sharks/sea creatures, Alien type Xenomorphs.

Any suggestions for books featuring more original/unusual scary beasts?"

I've been looking recently at the Uplift series, but didn't know how seriously I could take it - how hard on the scale is it?

The Xeelee sequence has caught my attention. I prefer the harder edge of scifi, though I've never read Baxter. I like that there are plenty of books in the series so if I get hooked, there's plenty to go at. How does it compare to, say, Uplift, or Revelation Space? I loved the darkness of Reynolds.

So in 2008, I had a fairly good, but very sedentary job where they fed us lunch. I have always been a bit pudgy (a combination of a little bad genetics, a lot of laziness, and a nervous eating habit), but I really started to balloon upwards. 

One day, I went into the Dr's for my first yearly in several years, as I had been mostly too broke to go for years. What the found finally scared me enough to to something. Elevated liver function, some strange cardiac behavior, and so very scary looking deposits around my liver.

It's taken a LONG time, but I've managed to really change both my eating and exercise habits. I'm still a little way from where I wanna be, but I'm pretty happy with what I've done so far!

What I Did: We(my wife and I) started with Weight Watchers. A good program, with some decent slow progress. The biggest thing I took from WW was learning portion control. That was for awhile. When I got back out of school and to my current job, there was a lot of food laying around in common area, and I started to slip.

1958,"Hey all! A week ago I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/167gcz/i_21m_am_falling_for_best_friend_19f_and_im_not/) wondering what to do about my feelings. Unfortunately I can't remember what I made the password for the first throwaway, so this is v2. 

I spent a couple days thinking about it, and after most of you told me to go for, I decided on Friday that that was what I was going to do. 

We were hanging out on Saturday at her place, listening to music and just talking, when I started talking about how we always go out together, just the two of us. We'll meet up and go get dinner, see a movie, go get some ice cream and then I'll drop her off at her place. This probably happens once or twice a week, although it isn't always the same thing. I told her that to me, it seems like we're casually dating except without any kind of physical contact. I went on about how I really enjoy spending time with her, and just doing whatever with her. It doesn't matter what, we can just sit in a room and talk about nothing and everything for hours. 

Eventually she got a little impatient and said, ""So what're you trying to say?"" I asked her if she would be interested in going on a *real* date with me, as more than just friends. She seemed to think about it for a second and then told me that she didn't have any plans Monday night. I told her that I'd come pick her up at 6. The rest of the night continued normally, although I was completely ecstatic. 

Fast forward to Monday and I show up to her house sweating bullets. She's wearing the dress I got her for her birthday last year and looks absolutely beautiful. I tell her as much and she gives me a kiss on the cheek and we hold hands as we walk to my car. I took her out to dinner at one of our favorite restaurants, and then we went and saw Silver Linings Playbook (great movie btw). After the movie I took her over to a small amusement park area called Belmont Park and we walked along the boardwalk there holding hands and just talking. None of it was awkward and neither of us could seem to stop smiling the whole time. 

By now it was late and freezing cold, so we decided to go back to her place and make some hot chocolate. We flirted and teased each other the whole time, shared our first kiss, and I ended up spending the night there. We're a couple now and I can't remember being this happy. :) 

Thank you to everyone who told me to go for it! I can never express how much I appreciate all of your comments! 

TL;DR Maned up and asked her on a date. She accepted. Had the greatest first date of my life. Took her back home, had our first kiss, made love, and now we're together. "

2. The tasks are mundane, repetitive, and hence very easy to complete - I try slowing down but I can finish a months work in a day 

I can easily get a marketing job in the commercial world, as I had some experience in the field, but that will bring me lower pay and longer hours.

1973,"I found an [illustration](http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs46/i/2009/223/6/1/larvitar_family_slow_evo__by_metallicatakeover.jpg) of Larvitar evolving into Pupitar, and then into Tyranitar, but it's not just three images side-by-side of the three Pokemon, but rather an illustration of how Larvitar might look whilst evolving into it's final forms.

I feel like this is a great concept because I've always found it a bit odd that Pokemon just automatically turn into different ones in a flash of light (this is how the anime demonstrates it as well, so this theory is really nothing but noise).  What if Pokemon evolved like the image showed -- slowly developing into different forms?  Perhaps, as they leveled!  Or, what if Pokemon hatched at slightly different form than the stage they're at, and slowly grow/change into their base evolutionary form?  Thoughts?

1974,"All of a sudden, I've got curious why you guys are so into (or hate extremely) HIMYM. 
Somebody might watch this TV show to kill some time, but for somebody it could mean something like me.

For me, I had a very bad break-up with my ex-fiance. And this TV show was one of the TV shows we used to watch together.
After the break-up, I missed him a lot having miserable time.(Close to depression, to be fair-couldn't eat, sleep, or of course hang out other people at all for a while)
So I started watching this show and it helped me cry and let out all the sorrow inside of me. And sometimes I could even laugh watching the shows.
I often went through all season one night crying and laughing.
They have love, sad, funny, break-up, happy (etc.) moment, and I've learned that life goes on. It might sound silly, but it is true that I've got better from this TV show than the word ""Cheer up"" from my friends.

Edit 2: WOW, I am totally overwhelmed by all of your compliments. I can't tell you how much this all means to me, because I fangirl over reddit like the rainbow-barfing kitty cat that I am. Seeing my name on the frontpage will seriously be one of the highlights of my career.

I'm going to check out for a while, but i'll come back later tonight or tomorrow and try to answer as many questions as possible. THANK YOU all.

1992,"So, I know ""cold turkey"" seems to be the thing to do, but I've been decreasing my cigarettes for the past week, and was down to 2 today, and have my last one set for tomorrow.  I'm a 21 year old female, and have only been smoking for about a year, and had been planning to quit right after graduation, but last week had a strange compelling urge to do this sooner rather than later.

I watched my grandfather die from emphysema, and my grandmother is on oxygen now because of smoking her whole life.  My mom's side of the family mostly smokes, and seeing my mom pick it up again recently for the first time in about 20 years really terrified me.  I figure, my grandparents are old, they're going to die anyway, but the thought of losing my mom at a too-young age from something as stupid as cigarettes just makes me angry and upset.  And I don't want to go down that road myself.  And, hearing my dad, who doesn't smoke, make concerned comments about how he wishes we would quit just makes me want to cry.

So, tomorrow, hopefully, I'm done.  Smoking seems, honestly, like a cool thing to do while I'm a college student, but it's not going to look so cool when I'm old and wrinkly and lightin up.  Or when I'm dead.

So here's to quitting...this post is mainly to motivate and keep me accountable if (when?) I think to myself that it couldn't hurt to go through one more pack before stopping for good.  Cause that's bullshit.  Done with this."

2006,"Reddit has completely changed my life in a relatively positive manner. The  scientific-oriented hivemind of reddit has made me a much more rational and reasonable person. Reddit has also made me into a much more empathetic person. 

It's also completely changed my school. I go to a bible belt school and ever since I introduced my rather conservative friends to reddit, they've become much more open minded and reasonable. They accept LGBT people, and are now mostly agonstic-atheists now (not that there's anything wrong with being religious, it's just that they were the  ones that pushed their beliefs down people's throats)"
2007,"I live in San Francisco. Due to my place in one of the most liberal cities in the United States, I am spared a lot of the ignorance and conservative viewpoints prevalent in many other parts of the country.

Today in Union Square the World Life Organization had a HUGE stage up, complete with a big screen tv flashing pictures of dismembered fetuses. I couldn't help but stare at the crowd of 200, the weepy women going up and saying how they could never abort, the MAN on the microphone.

I started shaking, my heart beat faster. Finally I stormed up to the front, and asked if I could say something.

He was obviously hesitant, and finally got one of his accomplices to hold the microphone while I spoke; I guess he was scared I would run off with it?

""Have you ever had an abortion?"" I asked him.

""No.""

""We'll I have,"" I said in the microphone. ""I was young and not ready. I was preached abstinence and didn't know about birth control. I wasn't ready to bring a child into this already-overpopulated world. I aborted, and I'm here to say I'm FINE. I'm happy, I'm healthy, I'm beautiful. I work a great job and am in a fantastic relationship. I can't wait till the moment in the future when I AM ready to have a child. So I don't think you have any right whatsoever to speak about morality when you've NEVER had to make that decision.""

I walked away while he ridiculed me in front of the crowd. A few people tried to block my way, a few people shouted ""you don't LOOK happy"".

I guess I'm just looking for support. I just admitted to over 200 people that i had an abortion. It's been an hour and my adrenaline is pumping, I'm still on the verge of tears and I'm FURIOUS. I am all for freedom of speech, and I'm glad I live in a country where anyone can get on a microphone and preach whatever they want. 

Was I out of line?

Edit: wow, ladies, thank you so much. I went from feeling powerless and small to feeling like I did the right thing. Thank you so much for the reddit gold, whoever you are.

Also, as a disclaimer- I don't mean to sound like the fact that I live in San Francisco means there are no ignorant people, but most people think twice before protesting in front of planned parenthood, or making conservative political statements. Also, the fact that he was a man DOESN'T MEAN HE'S NOT ENTITLED to his opinion. But holding an opinion and preaching to a crowd about what I am supposed to do with a uterus he has never had is a bit different.


Edit2: I didn't post this to start a debate or get harassed via PM's. this is my main account and I'm afraid I need to make a new one. I have absolutely no desire to fuel an argument about the semantics of my speech- I had 30 seconds to spew out some feelings and tell my story in front of a lot of people. Sue me for not choosing the right choice of words on the spot.

And Jesus Christ, YES MEN ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE AN OPINION, even though they don't have a uterus. Okay? "

But I have to hold my foot on the input jack, otherwise I get a loud static noise. Any idea on how to fix that? The pickup is wired directly to the output jack.

Basically it's something you would do every time you 'do the deed' whether you do it before you kill them (call them on their cellphones), during the killing (how you kill them), or after the victim is dead (slicing off skin with hair on it).

A gimmick could also be that you target unique individuals (Immigrants, widows over the age of 65, even other serial killers)

2018,"Let me clarify. Every moment from age 15 when I gave my life to Jesus, to now (age 22), I have been a Christian. Sure, there have been moments of ignoring the Christian faith and living a ""worldly"" life, but my last 3 years in college have been completely devoted to campus ministry, and discipling others. It has been a positive experience, for the most part. I have met many friends, and I have a wonderful support system through this ministry. Over the last few months though, I have been feeling more and more like this is kind of a lie. I am at a turning point in my life where I either need to give myself over completely to Christianity, or drop it and move on. Basically, I need resources to make a decision. Is there anyway you can help me, via personal stories that are similar, book recommendations, youtube links, etc.? I want to be able to see this from every perspective, and will also be praying and searching the bible and bible resources in accompaniment to whatever is provided by you guys. I would really appreciate your help and would love to discuss this with someone. Thanks!

2041,"I think most of us will agree that one of the most important aspects of a game (besides story/gameplay) is the BGM of the game. Music adds an emotional depth to games that normally would be unattainable through typical means (like storytelling). So my question to you guys is, what are your favorite soundtracks that have stuck with you in your years of gaming?

I'll start. For me, my favorite soundtrack by far would probably be FFVI's. Every single track in it was simply so memorable and emotional, and I imagine that without it, FFVI (while it would still likely be a classic) would have been only a mere shadow of what it is. However, a close runner-up to FFVI would definitely be the relatively unknown Eternal Sonata. It's really a shame the game was relatively unpopular (unsurprisingly as it admittedly had a subpar story and gameplay) for the soundtrack is probably one of the finest that I've ever heard. Motoi Sakuraba really outdid himself when he was writing it as it's definitely one of his finest accomplishments. But anyways, I'm rambling. So what do you guys think?"

2043,"Mojang said that they wanted to theme all of their updates and fix and update things that need to be fixed and updated. I'm thinking it's about time for a biome system update.

--Ever notice how many posts there are about mods that add a better biome system? 

The current biome system is alright, it has a lot of nice features. However, I more appreciated the smooth transitions of the old one, I almost never knew what biome I really was in, and I preferred it that way. There was a lot of nice variations, too, such as forests on hills and mountains in different locations and not just mountain biomes.

Here's a thought, this could be re-implemented http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/File:BiomesGraph.png

I think that biomes should come in different ""variations."" A lot of people preferred the tiagas before snow, so why not throw in a version without snow? Each biome could actually be a combination of certain features. Some examples:
snow mountains,
snow forest,
snow spruce/pine forest,
snow mushroom island,
snow plains,
forest mountains,
treeless swamps,
snowy swamps,
dry spruce/pine forests,
etc. Stuff like that, more combinations of biomes.
Also nice would be in the nether possible hell mountains, hell plains, hell forests(?), hell oceans, etc.

Tl;dr the current biome system is very unrealistic, biome neighbors should be more realistic and biomes should come in more variations."

Ok, I know the pics aren't *that* dramatic - yet - but, I told myself I would post on day 30 to hold myself accountable :)

[Here's the visual progress.](http://imgur.com/uzY3g)

Here's the physical:

14.2 pounds down

.25 inch lost in each arm

1 inch lost in each thigh

1.5 inches lost in the waist

1 inch lost in the hips

.75 inch lost in the chest

3 inches lost in the belly! 

For the next 30 - 60 days, the goal is to get to a size 6 jean and exercise more. By the pics, it looks like I'm losing some junk in the trunk... must... lunge... and squat... ಠ_ಠ"

2060,"I'm about to embarrass myself, because I'm probably overlooking some super obvious cultural touchstone.

Are there any books that utilize the following concept?

Aliens show up at Earth, and they say something like:

Yo. You didn't think the first bacteria just spontaneously formed four billion years ago, did you? We sent those bacteria to make the planet livable. Sorry evolution accidentally produced your sentience and all, but this is kind of our planet, so we're taking it back now. Thanks!

I'm fascinated by the concept of unintended consequences of bacterial terraforming. So anything along those lines would be cool (of course, a recommendation might be a spoiler like a certain second book in a very popular quartet, so I'm not sure how to avoid that)."

2062,
2063,"  Firstly, I wanted to thank everywhere on this sub. You were all so nice when I came here after coming back to Christianity from atheism and it really is nice to have a place to have a spiritual moment or discussion, even if for a little bit a day, because most of my friends are very hostile to religion. So just always like to be appreciative. 



Secondly, I found a church home. It’s a Lutheran congregation, very small, mostly gray haired. I sadly won’t be able to be with them long since I’m leaving to move a long way off for a job in August. I looked into my options in the place I’m moving to and the same thing: mostly stagnant churches in this denomination I’ve chosen. So why did I? Why didn’t I go back to my Catholic past or join a thriving denomination? Well the main reason is that after a lot of prayer and study I just simply love Lutheranism. The confessions and the movements within it are deeply inspiring and intellectually rich. The Book of Concord, Neo-Lutheranism, Pietism, all of it. I’m just called by it and I find myself in agreement with it. I truly do. I find that when I want to read something theological I consistently am going back to Lutheranism. Also, my love of apostolic Christian unity may be deep but my spirit is calling me elsewhere and so I give it up to God. Like Luther at Worms: “I can do no other. God help me! Amen.” Also, my parents are coming back to Church again because of my reversion to Christianity, so amen to that!



But most of all I’m not going to let the decline of mainline Protestantism scare me into doing something I don’t feel called to do. If I truly feel this is right for me then I should engage this church and work for change. Running away from a challenge isn’t my game. So many people I talk to in mainline denoms are saddened by the decline but few are those who will do anything to save it. To love something is to fight for it. Revival can happen. I’ve seen it. I believe it. We’ve got a lot of history to learn from. We just have to draw from it. From Presbyterian seminaries with brilliant Barth scholars to rich Lutheran choir tradition to Wesleyan holiness living. These are powerful wells from which to draw a renewal. 



Yes churches will shrink and yes we may feel trapped and pushed to irrelevancy but far be it for Christians of all people to get all hopeless. I am firm in the belief that the mainline denoms will survive. Somewhere in a Lutheran mission a woman with a smile and a cross on her neck will welcome a meth addict and bring blankets for him when he shakes in the night and screams the demons out of himself, grinding his teeth to dust and perhaps…uttering a prayer. Somewhere a Methodist man will dole out soup and bread to hustlers and needle junkies who are absolutely convinced that no one on this Earth loves them. Somewhere a Presbyterian preschool will teach children to love God and neighbor in kindness and joy. Somewhere an Episcopalian priest will baptize an ex-prostitute and welcome her into the family of God. 



And in all of this the mainline denoms will carry on preaching Word and Sacrament. The lost will know that the cross of Christ is theirs to claim. They’ll know that Jesus can pour out grace and free them from the bondage of sin. They’ll know that the saints will judge the world and that they too can be a saint.



So consider this not only a flair change but a word to all those dismayed that their traditions, so deeply loved, are shrinking. There’s always hope. Always. So let's get out and work for it!

2065,
2066,"Lately I have felt a general sense of hostility towards twitch stream related submissions on this sub-reddit. I would like to take this time to clarify some points that are factually inaccurate and somewhat inflammatory. 

**1. You guys make boat loads of money from people watching you!**


There are 3 sources of streaming income. donations, ad/subscription revenue from twitch, sponsors.

To date I have received around $450 USD in donations, All of it went into equipment purchases such as a BLUE Snowball Mic and Avermedia Capture Card. I appreciate the generosity of those viewers and I try my best to not mention donations on stream. Some streamers have scrolling texts and messages that promote donations, but that's a personal choice that I am uncomfortable with. 

Sponsors, few people will receive actual cash from sponsors instead it is usually in a product endorsement format. I have contacted numerous gaming related companies and their offers are mostly product based. That is not to say that some of the top streamers don't have cash deals, but it's quite rare.

Ad/Subscription Revenue from Twitch, this is what most people believe to be the money tree of streaming. OMG we watch ads and you get revenue so We are PAYING YOUR BILLS. [Here's the my monthly ad income](http://imgur.com/mC7zElA), The prerolled ads come from twitch and I have hit the roll ad button once to test it. So we get 0 dollars from that. Feel free to run Adblock, I know I do. 

Now let's talk costs, Todd and I live in Peterborough/Toronto Canada, Unlimited bandwidth with good upload speed is fairly hard to come by, Bell only recently provided truly unlimited bandwidth with good upload, and neither Todd nor I have access to it. Todd is on cogeco, I am on start. The first 2 month of streaming Todd's monthly ISP bill was $600CDN due to the overage fees, and I currently pay about $150-$200 a month. Of course not all the cost is due to the stream, but 2MB/s UP for 15 hours a day adds up.


**2. If you don't make money, why do you guys do it?**

Because it's fun, and we enjoy helping players that are struggling with the game. Todd is a small business owner, I am a full time student that also carry a pretty decent paying job on the side. We are financially stable so we do not rely on the stream for money. Instead we stream because it makes the game more fun for both the broadcasters and the audience. Instead of grinding A3 alone for 6 hours a day, Todd and I can hop onto Team Speak and shoot the shit with our Mods and we can share the fun experience with our viewers. It usually takes around 10-15 hours to prep for a single educational Monday, we do the research, contact/invite guests, buy the possible parts on the AH, do the tests, tweak and optimize, complete the writeup document, and do the actual show. For Todd this is a daunting process since English is his second language. He has personally spent around 1.5B gold just in research and development for various wizard builds, the high PHYS-resist low LS archon build, budget CMs and the most recent Full Transformer sets took a lot of time, gold and effort.   

**3. Streamers Take Advantage of this Subreddit by Spam Advertising**

I have been a redditor long before diablo 3 released, I enjoy reddit because I can find people that are generally kind in nature and have civil discussions with them. I use to be heavily involved in the /r/tf2 and /r/tf2trade subs and started a community based projected called the Reddit Armory to help newer players there. Yes I do post to this reddit about once or twice a week on average, and my posts usually contain 1 link to my stream. That's usually for Educational Monday so those watching live can get the best deals on AH. The one time  I ""took advantage"" of this sub was for the purpose of charity, we raised $2000 USD for Autism Research and Child's Play, and I was immensely proud of this community.   

**4.Why Do People Watch Other People Play this SHITTY GAME?**

First of all I still enjoy D3 immensely and since most of us live in free countries we can play what we want. Now why do people watch streams? There's entertainment focused streams that do fun events and giveaways, there are educational streams that teach things, there are ""hero worship"" streams where people just drool over a guys ""godly"" gear. So each streamer has a different take and vision on what they want to do. Todd and I wanted to create a community where people can come and hangout, we wanted to share information and knowledge about the game and hopefully in the slightest way possible make this game better and more enjoyable. 

**5. Quit your bitching, No one is forcing you to stream, You attention seeking whore!**

This is true, it's nice to be e-famous and have many internet friends. However in real life ""I run a D3 Stream"" does not impress anyone. Any streamer disillusioned to think otherwise will run the risk of hubris and will eventually suffer a rude awakening. 

We are human beings just like you, therefore sometimes we do get emotional. My anti-trolling paragon level is pretty high due to wasting my youth on the interwebz, however for my partner Todd who has less exposure to trolls, accusations and insults appears extremely personal. I would like to say that our stream chat is one of the least moderated and most polite one I have seen on twitch, and for that I would like to thank everyone. It is discouraging sometimes when after all your hardwork, people still find the tiniest things to bitch at you and put you down. However we made the conscious decision of putting ourselves out there as semi-public figures , so we must also accept the consequences.  

**I apologize for this wall of text, it is my best attempt at conveying some clarifications and frustrations as concisely as possible, If you read through all of it, Thank You**

**TL:DR, Not All Streamers Make $ from streaming, in fact for most of us it's loss generating investment of time and money. We do it because it's fun and adds some flavor to the game. Having a platform to help a wide range of people is also very convenient. We will try our best to limit our posts in this subreddit, but I feel that our content contributes positively in a sea of ""GEARING HELP/IDEA!"" posts. People watch streams while they play games because it's fun to them and it's a free country. We need to vent sometimes because despite our best efforts the hate eventually has some impact. Thank you!**

2069,There is an alien race that is hyper advanced to a point where diseases are minor annoyance at best and they can live for a long time. All of the members of that alien race have powers but not all of them choose to develop them. Humans are puny by comparison. They don't live long. Their technology is centuries behind and many aliens see them as barbarians because of first contact incident where a human fleet shot one of the alien ship without some form of warning. Why would the aliens consider helping humans in a time of need? Why would they decide to teach humans to use their powers? Why would they assist humans who are at war with each other or another alien race?
2070,"Hi, I haven't managed to find a series that fits these criteria. By readable I mean that it shouldn't have too many characters/too much lore such that it is difficult to absorb; I'd like something decently light but not too sparse in terms of worldbuilding complexity. A grim setting is fine but there should be some hope remaining! 

Also, the plot should ideally be quite fast-paced, logical and not too cheesy. The characters should also be reasonably complex. Battles should be well-written and action-packed with cool sci fi tech and preferably spaceships. 

If it helps, I've read 3 books in the Vorkosigan Saga and I think I'd like something with a bit more action. I've also read Starship Troopers, The Forever War, Ender's Game (and the Ender's Shadow Series) and Old Man's War which I've all enjoyed very much. 

Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance! :)

EDIT: Doesn't need to be a series; standalone books are perfectly fine. Would also prefer a series that isn't too long so that I can actually finish it without getting sick of the setting! "

2079,"Started December 30th. Started seeing a girl I've been friends with and have liked for at least two years. Long-distance, so NoFap is a relatively easy commitment to manage. 

At the 15-day mark, I've noted subtle physical changes. Nothing to blow your mind- consistent, hard erections in the middle of the night, growing sensitivity, etc. More impressive have been the mental changes- an increased tolerance/desire to man up and get shit done, increased desire for human contact, and growing desire to be involved in other people's lives. The latter is most important- we are made to relate to the world and to others, and desensitization through PMO perverts that natural function. Engagement of self with world is effetively found with care/concern with others, not just with some notion of self-improvement. 

Definitely going to commit to this long-term. Sure it's about improving sex life, productivity, and general manhood, but more importantly it's about being human, which is pretty fucking awesome."

I suppose it's just so thick and the language used is hard to wrap my head around. I'm just having trouble understanding it and drawing wisdom from it.

Also a little off topic, I've been reading through the account of Solomon in Kings alongside this and it seems that Solomon commits apostasy but doesn't repent. His heart is drawn away to his wives and other gods and he dies. Doesn't mention repentance or restoration. Does this mean that Solomon died in his sin? I suppose if we had access to *the Acts of Solomon* we would know for certain, but it appears this book has been lost to time. "

I Do Not Want To Work In A Kingdom

Today my boss decided to use my image as a promotional tool. This is not my job. I have signed no release. 

I am a full time editor at a small Production company. I have a BFA in Film and have worked here for almost two years, making me one of the most senior members of the editing staff.  With this comes a heavy workload, and a lot of responsibility. 

Repeatedly, in the last two years, I have been asked to walk my bosses dog, or get coffee, or pick up everyones lunches. When I was the newest member of the team, this seemed fair. It is a regular part of the job of a Production Assistant, and I was happy to have the work. But that is no longer my position at this company, and as an editor with a product deadline to meet, I don't have time for this. We currently have several production assistants whose job this is. But I continue to be asked to perform these tasks.

I have also been directed to be in promotional media from time to time. This includes having my picture in newspaper articles, and acting in pilots for new products. I have represented the company several times in this way. I am the only editor ever told to do this. We do have talent that we hire on an as needed bases, who may be more appropriate to this kind of promotional piece, and who are paid for the use of their image. 

Perhaps you think I should be flattered. You would be wrong.  I am the only young female at this production company. THIS SHOULD MAKE NO DIFFERENCE IN HOW I AM TREATED.

I have never been ASKED to participate in these shoots. I have not been paid for the use of my image. My time, which is needed for the editing projects I was hired to complete, is never considered.  

Today I had an extra heavy workload. But when my boss arrived at work I clearly overhead him discussing, with my fellow co-worker, how I was to act in a promotional commercial. After I overhear this conversation about me, my boss (the CEO of the company) walk by my office with a simple “hi”. 

Despite being one of the most senior editors at this company, I was not consulted on my part in this project. I was not ASKED. 

Later the CEO wanders into my office to borrow some push-pins from my bulletin board. I have decided I have had enough and that I am not ok with being used in things that are far outside my job description, without my consent. I confront my boss. I tell him that I wished to be ASKED when these projects arise, and that my time was very constrained today. I pointed out that there were many other employees with lighter workloads, that could participate in this side project. 

My bosses response was that because I was the most “attractive” employee he had chosen me to be in this commercial. My response : “ That is misogynistic, and unwelcome”. 

This is when I was told to have a private conversation with the CEO. Behind a closed door, in the meeting room, he explained to me about how we valued “teamwork” here, and that he didn't like having employees with “bad attitudes”. 

I responded saying that if he was ASKING me to perform in this pronominal piece based on my acting ability, or based on the amount of free time I had after completing my regular work, it might be appropriate. Appropriate to ASK, not assume. His response was to make it clear that no acting ability was needed, and that I was selected because I was “attractive”. He told me that he did not care if I found this offensive. He then proceeded to tell me that my workplace was not a democracy but a “Kingdom”. He pointed out that since he had used my image in the local newspaper last week that it made sense to use my image again. He had not ASKED to use my image in the paper. This is not a good reason for him to feel he has continued access to the use of my image without my consent. It is an extremely poor justification.

His next words were very carefully selected. “Those who don’t have an attitude of teamwork at this company, will not be eligible for advancement, and may find themselves not employed here anymore.” It was a clear threat to my job, but worded in such a way that there wasn't much to report to HR. He gave himself deniability, while making it clear that I had no choice in the use of my image, and no foothold in fighting against his sexual harassment. 

He then gave me a halfhearted “This isn't in your job description, so you don’t HAVE to do it.” He knew he had backed me into a corner. He would have my image, without my consent, or he would take away my livelihood. 

I weakly reiterated to him that I wished to be ASKED in the future. I wanted him to realize that the use of my image in his side projects should not be assumed. But I felt frightened and defeated. 

As my co-worker set up around me for the commercial shoot, he asked what my boss had said to me. I told him that he had threatened my job if I did not participate in this commercial. My co-worker did not seem surprised. I said “well I think we will see what HR has to say about this”. But my co-worker shot this idea down. “Do you really want to make waves?” he askes me. He reminds me of a former employee who was suddenly fired on a whim from the CEO. “We have a pretty easy gig here,” he tells me “and there will be guys like this CEO everywhere”. 

I then told him something that I think the whole world needs to hear. Yes, right now there are people who think they can manipulate, and threaten their way into what they want. They think they are entitled to anything they want from their employees. They are sure, that with a little pushing, and by instilling a little fear, they can have all the control. 

This can only happen if we allow it to. These people can only act this way if we let them. We can only be trod upon and frightened if we allow it. With an attitude of “There is no place else that would be different or better” and “ It is safer to be quiet and give them what they want” we lose our humanity, and give up our power and control. 

But I am not just an “attractive woman”. I am an educated film editor, who has consistently met deadlines and performed above expectations. I am strong and smart and experienced. I should not have anyone who thinks they can trod on me, or make me feel threatened in my life. 

Today starts my job hunt.  I’m seeking a new team. Not a “Kingdom”, but a safe and welcoming workplace that will treat me like an experienced editor, and a human being. I am not object to look pretty in commercials I will not be taken advantage of. I am not here to fulfill every whim that strikes my bosses fancy. 

I want to work for a functioning company with morals. Not a Kingdom. 


Edit: 
I think some people are missing the most important thing here. He wasn't threatening my job because I protested being in his stupid commercial. It was once I told him that calling me ""attractive"" was UNWELCOME that he shut us in the meeting room and started threatening my job, while asserting that he didn't care if I was offend by being called ""attractive"". And that IS sexual Harassment. He made it clear that ""Being a team player"" meant allowing him to use my ""attractiveness"" to meet his promotional needs, no matter how I felt about it. And that is misogyny. "

Then I got stuck at 145 lbs for a while.  

I wanted to say, I managed to lose those ""last 15 pounds!""  My wonderful boyfriend helped me start going to the gym regularly - I was kind of embarrassed because I didn't know how to use any of the machines or do any exercises.  He helped me find a cardio/weightlifting program that's worked quite well for me, and we looked up how to do each exercise on YouTube before attempting it at the gym (to make sure I was doing it correctly.)  We also mostly cut out sugar and started putting more protein in our diets.

Over the summer, I managed to get down to 130 lbs.  My boyfriend had also wanted to gain weight - he put on 20 lbs and got more muscular!  So we were both victorious!

However, the holidays hit, and I was eating a lot of my sister's yummy holiday baking.  I'm back at around 132 now and have stayed there consistently.  I would love to lose another 5-10 lbs so I'm back on loseit to kick my butt in gear.  I don't have a very specific goal because sometimes it surprises me how much or how little a 5-lb loss will show on my frame, so I'm just going in with an open mind, but I'm hoping to land somewhere around 120 lbs.

[Here's my updated before/after!](http://i.imgur.com/F7dwuxP.jpg?1) 

Any suggestions to get back on track would be warmly welcomed! :)

2107,"It has been just under a month since my last cigarette.  I no longer have the physical addiction for sure, and the habits really don't present themselves much, but I am still having a very hard time.  So many posts I see on here are so positive & exciting after this much time has passed; it's not how I feel.  
I **hate** being a non-smoker.  I never realized how much I looked forward to each cigarette throughout the day, and removing it from my life has taken away so much pleasure from my normal daily life.  
I still have it plenty good overall, but just have trouble looking forward to anything now.  My overall mood is dismal, and I generally feel like a basket case.  My SO is clueless - he sees the situation very black and white: gross & unhealthy -> don't do it anymore. When I try to express how it's affecting me, he'll make a joke or say something sexual. He just doesn't understand.
Everyone else seems to see major improvement after 30 days, why am I still stuck in this rut?"

2113,"I got my first royalty payment of $7.83 from my party game book, The Movie Murder Mystery Party. It's not much, but it's a start! I used Lulu to publish the eBook version to the Nook and iBookstore and CreateSpace for the paperback version. I wanted to celebrate and share what I've learned so far about self-publishing. For reference, I have three books out now. The other two are Uncovering Oklahoma's 2013 Date Idea Book (just released a week ago) and Lessa's Unbound Dilemmas at the Library. 

- It's easier and faster to publish eBooks directly with Nook and the iBookstore than with Lulu. It would take about a week before the party game book appeared on each store when I used Lulu. Directly with the stores it was less than 24 hours.
- The iBookstore store is the only place you need an ISBN for an eBook. 
- On third-parties, skip them. For my date idea book and Unbound, I bought an ISBN to publish directly with the iBookstore. Although I won't get any payments until I reach $150 versus $5 with Lulu, but I will receive more. (Lulu takes a cut.) 
- The cheapest site I've found for an ISBN is $9 through ePubBud. The only catch is ePubBud is listend as the publisher with the broker, but you can list yourself as the publisher everywhere else. In other words, on iTunes for the Date Idea Book, Uncovering Oklahoma is listed as the publisher. 
- You don't get any payments if someone buys your book directly from Lulu if you set it for 0.99. However, I haven't had any one buy any of my eBooks from them. 
- Other than the iBookstore, you cannot set your eBook to be published on a future date. 
- The eBook version of The Movie Murder Mystery Party has sold more copies than the paperback version, which is surprising since the paperback version was designed so people can cut out the characters and clues for the game. The lesson: have an eBook version of your book.
- Publishing books with a bleed on CreateSpace is a pain. I ended up just reformatting my date idea book without any image bleeds. I'm happy with the print quality of all of my books with them. 
- Knowing the right person really does help. I am friends with a girl who works the front desk of a news station. I gave her a copy of my date idea book this afternoon about about an hour later, a producer from the station called me. I have my first interview next Friday.
- As for publishing on Google Play, the interface is not user friendly, especially compared to the Kindle and Nook services.

2116,"While I'm interested in this question for a lot of reasons, my primary reason is that I'm a minister. I see people every week say that they are Christian but they don't have anything that would lead me to think that, because I don't see them following Jesus commands ([John 14:15](http://bible.cc/john/14-15.htm)).

At my church, we talk about the Christian ""walk with God"" and the first step, after professing one's faith in Jesus as Lord and Savior is to be baptized. But very few people ever seem to do anything beyond that besides attend church to be spoonfed their faith. It bothers me that all these people are in church on Sunday but don't care the rest of the week.

To clarify my question - what made you decide to step up past being someone who just attends church? What made you decide to really try to follow Jesus? I'm just making the assumption that you guys do, since you spend your spare time on a subreddit dedicated to learning more about Christianity. Thanks for any answers!

2122,"Hi everyone,

I have to first say that this subreddit is such an excellent idea to have and such a help for those of us who want to improve in our self-control and discipline. I would advise that you use this subreddit as much as possible through your journey, and not only when you relapse. I've actually stayed away from fapping for a year and a half, it was so empowering knowing that I can and will achieve much greater than that. I know I just recently relapsed and I responded by telling myself that I was just gonna keep doing the same but just try harder this time. That's when I remembered a quote that says ""the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over, and expecting a different result"". While this may or may not be true in some circumstances, when it comes to discipline and self-control we have to see what went wrong the last time we did relapse, and work on that mistake. Which brings me to why I'm writing this, I thought you all could use a few pointers that has helped me stay away from fapping:



****If you've relapsed, report it to NoFap or to a close friend, find out the reason why you did then state what you're going to do differently this time in order to avoid that mistake in the future****



This is to help you keep accountable to what you're doing. Humans have a natural tendency to be irresponsible if they're not held accountable. By reporting it to someone it also helps you gain encouragement and an outside perspective when you do discuss it with people or a person. *Those who think they can handle it and do it all on their own are usually the ones who fall the hardest*, it takes a lot of strength in character to be able to admit you have a problem or that you've messed something up, I look up to people who can and are willing to admit their problems. Keeping it to yourself is the easy route. However, after you've done this, you want to make sure you talk about what you're going to do differently this time. Make sure you state what you've learned from that mistake so you won't repeat it again. This helps give room for a *productive and forward thinking conversation*, instead of just basking in regret of your mistake. You'll start to think like a winner, and a determined person. We're all not perfect and we all experience problems and shortcomings, but I think the real winners are the one's who accept their mistakes, identify what went wrong, and proceed to fix it. It's how we learn, build, and perfect anything. So in sum **accept and identify that you did relapse, find out why you did relapse (in other words, what happened/preceded before you relapsed), and state a solution for that problem if you come across it again in the future.**



****Most of the battle in this journey will have to be won in your mind first****



Now this point is probably the biggest of all and has been the factor behind most of my successes in life period! You have to come to a decision about what kind of thoughts you want to think, and those thoughts will make you who you are. They become a part of your personality and behaviour. These thoughts eventually expand and form the type of person who you are or who you want to be. I'm not just saying this because it sounds nice, it's backed up by scientific evidence summed up in [Amy Cuddy's TED talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks-_Mh1QhMc). It's a bit of a lengthy video but trust me, it's totally worth it! That talk can help you in more ways than one, and is a gold mine for becoming and achieving anything you want to. This is basically done if you ""fake it, til you make it"". When you change your thoughts, your behaviour basically cannot help but become what you think. Don't feel confident? don't feel encouraged? don't feel like you'll last long? Forget all those thoughts! Fake your confidence, determination, and self-disciplin until you become it! Watch the [TED talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks-_Mh1QhMc), she sums it up way better.  

This brings me to my reason as to why you have to win the battle in your mind first is because you are driven to act like you think. This is also based in the psychological concept of [cognitive dissonance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance), which is basically a psychological discomfort you experience when your thoughts/cognition don't align with your behavior. So for example when you keep thinking about pornography/sex/masturbating, and at the same time trying to convince yourself that won't do it. You're straight up lieing to your self, your being dishonest. When you experience this, you have two options: change your thoughts or change your behavior. You can see more explanations or examples from this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=korGK0yGIDo). In simple terms, you're trying to take away the discomfort of your conflicting thoughts and behavior by changing one of two things: your thoughts or your behavior. 

This is the major battle with masturbating, you have to win this battle in your mind, and not just through good intentions alone. Don't deceive yourself and think you're just watching something NSFW and that you won't do anything, you're just deceiving yourself. And you don't wanna be a deceptive person, especially not to yourself. So conclude that the situation is bad for you period! Get that straight in your mind and don't get caught up in it, because human behavior doesn't work like that way. Decide from now on, that once a situation has pornography/nudity/your fetish/arousing conversations and thoughts, etc, it WILL lead you to relapse. If you don't take the time to figure this out, you'll be convincing yourself to act in a way that doesn't align with your behavior. You will then experience the cognitive dissonance, and will be compelled to change your behavior, to masturbate, in order to align with the arousing thoughts. So make the journey easy for you, don't make this harder than it needs to be. Take the path of least resistance and use that time to build up your strength, self-control, and discipline. 



****Change your reward system when you accomplish no fapping in a day, week, and month****



Here you have to change how you reward yourself, because maybe some of us tend think that ""since I've gotten this far i deserve a reward so I should fap/watch porn/look at some girls/boys online"". This is another fall into deception, because your body is going to try all kinds of ways to get back into the old routine of things. Instead, what you can do is change how you reward yourself. For example, you can go watch a movie/ eat at your favorite restaurant/ go shopping/ tell someone to hold your ps3/xbox until you've achieved a month without fapping. Whatever it is make sure the reward applies to you and your life, it has to be something that you consider valuable or a treat to yourself. You have to change the way you celebrate successes, and what you celebrate with. So you not only are controlling you're thoughts and what you say to yourself now, your also controlling what you're rewarding yourself with too. Wow, your actually REALLY taking control of your life now!

Set goals for yourself by the day, week, month...........no I'm serious, right them down right now!!! Get creative with yourself and put it in a calendar, mark off the dates, count down to the week/month/months/year. Get as involved into setting these goals for yourself as you can. Put it in your reminders. 



****Be realistic about the challenges, create ""avoidance routines"" routines****



When your making out this plan for yourself, be realistic and list all the possible obstacles and temptations you think you will face and that you've faced in the past. The point here is so that you won't be surprised when something doesn't go the way you expected. One thing in this journey is that you don't ever wanna be surprised, do you ever see army men surprised when they go into battle? No! Because they train for every possible situation, so when they actually experience the battlefield, they have all the set routines for situations they may face. You know why secret agents, army men, police, etc train for so long?? It's because the training is to help them come up with possible routines about possible problems they can face in their line of work. So sit down and come up with an action plan, training or ""avoidance routine"" just like them, listing each problem you can and WILL face, then come up with methods or routines of how you will escape or avoid these problems.



****The first part is always the hardest, but once you can get over that you can make it the rest of the way!****



When people start any task, learn a new skill or topic, or make life changes, it almost always goes good for the first period they commit. This is totally normal, and that's why you hear a lot people going so hard at first and ready to take on the world. That's the nice part about making these changes! but sadly this part will fade with time and that's when your body will begin to say ""alright, I've been out of my comfort zone for too long, it's time to go back to my normal routine"". This is when you'll start feeling all the urges and all the mental/physical strings tugging you get back to your old habits. I want you to know that this is totally natural and you will experience it like any normal human being. It's happening because your starving your body of something, so it's gonna fight back, it's not gonna go away without a fight in you. But it's not about size of the dog in this fight, it's about the size of the fight in the dog. In other words, how determined are you to fight for this self-discipline and to gain your trust back? if you really want it you'll have to implement some mindhacks called ""self talk"" and you'll have to keep your mind mentally focused on your goal and nothing else. [Wikipedia has an article on self talk here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrapersonal_communication), it's basically what kind of conversation you have with yourself inside your head. People in some social psychology experiments who have talked to themselves leaning to one point of view, have been seen to make decisions based on what they were thinking about. So learn this skill and you can get past this tough part combined with reducing cognitive dissonance. 



****It will take a while until you can trust yourself again, but for now you can't****



One thing you'll have to come to terms with is that you cannot trust yourself right now, because each time you convince yourself that you can be trusted not to fap, you relapse again.... again.... and maybe sometimes for numerous occasions. Don't make this cycle in your life, I'm sure you don't want that, you want to live life to the fullest and not just be in this repetitive cycle of relapses. So you have to also admit that you cannot trust yourself for now because of what has happened. It's nothing bad, it's just the reality of things. Trust is one of those things that is broken easily, but takes a while to build back up again. That's because it's a very valuable thing, and anything worth having in life, is worth fighting for. So fight for it, fight for this trust back and stop at nothing to build it back up again! I want you to be able to trust yourself, so take time with this, take it one day at a time. You'll see your confidence in yourself grow day by day, and week by week. This confidence is key to help you keep going. 

One of the downfalls of accomplishment is that when we achieve something or get over a milestone we tend to get cocky and pride seeps in. **DON'T DO THIS, it's like the start of your path back to relapse practically.** If you achieve let's say a week, reward yourself, but focus on the next prize and keep going. That's why it's good to set many goals and not just one ultimate goal. So in short, don't get all cocky once you start going stay humble and keep setting goals. 



****Hold yourself accountable by emailing your future self****



This is not something you necessarily need to do, but I think it's good to help you put most of your resources into helping yourself gain confidence, trust, and self-discipline. You can email your self through this [site called futureme.org](http://www.futureme.org/) and it lets you write an email to your self but you get to set the date you'll receive the email. So you can write a letter to yourself asking yourself and encouraging yourself in your journey hoping that your journey is going good and hoping that you accomplished a lot by that date. Make yourself accountable in the email, and put expectations that you hoped to have achieved by then.


These are some of my tips that i used to success, sorry it's a bit lengthy but i really hope they work for you. Leave me a comment below if you have questions. All the best in this journey, I know you'll make it, you have it in you! If nobody believed in you in this life, I do, and I'm here along with everyone else to support you through this journey.



**TLDR; A summary of the main points:**

* Admit that masturbating/pornography/lust,etc. is a problem you have, identify why it occurs (what happens that causes you to do it), and say what you'll do in order not to repeat that mistake. This creates a productive and ""forward thinking"" conversation instead of just complaining and living in regret.

* The battle you have to win is mostly in your mind. Who cares if you don't feel like how you should, ""fake it til you make it"" and reduce that cognitive dissonance.

* Change your reward system, and how you define rewards. Set rewards for a certain amount of days, weeks, months, and even for a year!

* Be realistic about the challenges you'll face and create ""avoidance routines"". All people in fields/sports/services that require discipline do it, so you should too ;)

* The first part is always the hardest, but once you can get over that you can make it the rest of the way!

* It will take a while until you can trust yourself again, but for now you can't. Trust, most importantly with yourself, takes time to build back. 

* Hold yourself accountable by emailing your future self! This will help you reflect on the kind of person you want to become at a later date, and be sure to state some expectations for yourself. This way you can't blame anybody or anything for not living up to the expectations, because these are your own expectations.

2124,"In most of the science fiction media that I've consumed, most aliens are in a humanoid shape. They communicate in a similar way to humans. Sometimes they don't even differ much in appearance. I find this unrealistic because next to all aliens, due to entirely different ecosystems and environments, evolutionary history, and civilisation history, would in most likelihood be extremely if not totally different from us. 

What i'm looking for is science fiction with very alien aliens. Aliens that aren't like humans at all, or at least differ in some significant way. The kind of aliens i have in mind don't have: 

. Humanoid shapes

. The same way of communicating 

. The same beliefs, ideologies, or political structures  

. The same morality or ethics 

. The same way of physically moving 

. The same way of handling objects and tools

. The same senses of perception of the world 

. The same physiology

I also do not understand the logic of how Trunks could go toe to toe with someone that was on the same level as SSJB. They should have just given him the transformation if they were going to make him as strong as one.

I wanted to watch this movie for two reasons:

-It is one of Martin Scorsese's favourite movies (he funded the restoration of the film through his foundation)

-Daren Aronofsky said that this movie was his inspiration for Black Swan 

The movie turned out to be very good. It tells the story of an aspiring ballet dancer faced with a very demanding opera director. There are several dancing scenes, but you don't have to be interested in ballet to appreciate the film, and the restored copy of the movie is magnificent.

&nbsp;

This week is a bit uneventful due to the massive amount of work that had to be done. Still, I believe that we made a bit of progress.

&nbsp;

**Journal**

*Recap*: Last week I went into overdrive with narration.

&nbsp;

| *Day 1 - Mimic*

When I was typing up the report for last week, Marina insisted that I show her around the library. While I was practicing hearing my own mindvoice,she mimic'd me by going ""bleh bleh bleh"" with or tongue out. It was so cute!

&nbsp;



| *Day 2 - Uneventful*

When I woke up this morning, I made sure to say ""good morning"" to Marina (a habit I've been working on). I don't know why, but she seemed unusually chipper.

:--:

Barely narrated at all today. I kept getting caught up in one thing after another. I also had headaches in the latter half of the day. I tried to do some forcing once I got home, but I was too mentally fatigued.


&nbsp;



| *Day 3 - Lost Notes*

Most of the information for this entry was lost. From what I can remeber,  we did some forcing, that Marina was really quiet, and I had a lot of head pain.

I used the tulpa hypnosis file when forcing. I felt really close to her, but still couldn't hear her.

&nbsp;



| *Day 4 - Bad Host*

Very little narration today. I told her that I would force later and then got tired and went to sleep instead of forcing.

&nbsp;



| *Day 5 - Bad Host*

Very little narration today. Today was when all my work for the week collided. I wanted to force, but got caught up in relaxing.

&nbsp;



| *Day 6 - Bad Host*

Today also featured very little narration. I felt bad about the past 2 days and I wanted to make it up to her. But once again, I got distracted and completely flaked.

&nbsp;



| *Day 7 - Sentences*

I finally got around to forcing. Because I kept breaking my promise to force for the past 3 days, I gave her a sincere apology and asked for forgiveness. As far a I could tell she accepted it. She didn't make a big deal about it, probably because she could sense all the stress I was dealing with throughout the week. We practiced vocalization as we usually do, and I tried to work on visualizing the wonderland, as well as her facial features. Still, When it comes to our wonderland, I am essentially blind.

After forcing, I practiced playing my guitar for a bit. But when I started to get really intense head activiy, I quit playing so I could potentially hear Marina. While I was listening for her, I began questioning different aspects of my life and got a bit melancholy. To my amazement, she began talking to me(mindvoice)! She told me to ""put down the stupid guitar and listen."" She said that I can't keep blaming myself for everything. I was really comforted by this and, for the first time, I relly felt like she cared about me.

Her sentences weren't %100 complete, but it's a lot more than the 1 word responses that she's been giving me.

:--:

We (read: I) also tossed around some name ideas. The name ""Terra"" popped into my head and I really liked it. This led to me thinking of the name ""Nova"", which I also thought was an awesome name. I couldn't tell what she thought of them, though.

Later on, I started thinking about her name again, and the name ""Tess"" popped into my head. I believe that this was actually from her, since it doesn't seem like a name that I would think of on my own. While I still really like the names ""Terra"" and ""Nova"", I want her to be happy with her name first and foremost. I also played with the idea that ""Tess"" could be short for ""Tesla"", but I'm not sure if that name works for a female.

&nbsp;



*As of Writing*: Though the beginning of this week will be rough, it should ease up a lot later on. I hope to get back in to pratice then. Haven't heard much from her since Sunday, though she's making plenty of head pressure. Especially yesterday, I beleive that she was on the verge of making an auditory hallucination. I got really strong tenitis for about 10 minutes while forcing, and I felt like I could almost hear something.




&nbsp;

**Analysis**

*Questions Answered*:

* If a tulpa is already sentient, and partly vocal, can your progress be reversed if you mistakenly parrot them? *Only if you do it frequently. The occational parroting won't harm your tulpa.* (thanks: /u/A_Bloated_Seal, /u/DuckTruck)


*Questions Unanswered*

* None


*Research/Discussion Questions*:

* None


*Difficulties*

* Visualization

* Remembering to narration

* Forcing Regularly


*Discoveries/Observations*

None at the moment.


&nbsp;

**Plan so Far**

1. Personality + Generic Form

2. (When Vocal) Communication + Working together on form and personality + Wonderland <-

3. Tulpa's Journey
4. Imposition
5. Possession
6. Switching
7. ~~(Theoretical) Merging~~ will not attempt

&nbsp;

**Final Notes**

This week was intense, and I didn't give my tulpa as much attention as I would have liked, but I am happy with what progress was made

2180,"Hey loseit. I'm 23/f/182 lbs with a goal of 145lbs. This is my first completed week of weight loss/exercise.  I've been doing c25k, the running program,  and I've been tracking everything I eat with myfitnesspal.   I lost half a pound this week!

Real talk:
Myfitnesspal made me realize just how much beer I've been drinking.  It's difficult to get away from alcohol but I realize I've been using it as a social crutch, and not treating it as what it should be: a treat.  I have to face up to the fact that I've been using beer and food as a substitute for real positivity and dynamism in my life.

On the bright side, I feel a lot more energetic already.  I'm happier.  More focused on short term and long term goals, not just fitness but personal and career: I got an internship, am volunteering for the inauguration, Im going to go for a TESOL certificate.  My original goal was to complete c25k,  and if I do that I plan on continuing to do a 10k!

I had plans of traveling and living life to the fullest. In the few years that we've been together I've seen myself change into something I hate. I've been depressed, full of anxiety, transformed into a hermit, had my finances ravaged, and become someone stuck in a perpetual pity party.

None of this is your fault. I shouldn't have married you so early for the wrong reasons. I know you were lazy because I did absolutely everything for you. I forced you to call bill collectors for things you just haven't paid. I even called them FOR you. I'm not your mom. Your mom might still do everything for you but I deserve a MAN not a child.

If there's something that needs to be done, I get nothing from you but smoking weed and video games.

But that's neither here nor there. You may chose to live life like that, but I'm not gonna be dragged down with you. I'm going to change myself and stop using you as an excuse to not attempt to live a healthy life. My childhood situation wasn't too healthy, but that's no excuse. The only thing I have are the decisions that I make today, and I'm not going to regret them.

So today, I'm changing. I'm going to organize my life, I'm going to start living for myself and stop trying to take care of other people. I owe nothing to anyone. I don't have to take care of my dad. He made his bed now he can lay in it, I love him but he's a fully capable adult. If he's going to be homeless it's because he continually chose to not take action.

Wow I'm realizing that I married my dad pretty much. Someone who above all else makes excuses instead of actions. The chain stops now. Either you get on board or I'm gone by the end of this lease. I'm done waiting for you to change. I'm done waiting on myself to change.

I've been deeply enjoying playing with mods and FTB this time around. In the past, I watched a lot of DW20 videos and started building 9x9's myself. However, I'd like to change it up in my current world and build some aesthetic stuff as well. I've started my base around a silverwood tree that was in a crater in a hill, but I'm getting kinda stuck trying to build some nice walls, etc... 

Any inspiration (youtube videos, screenshots...) are more than welcome!

Some people already noticed my good mood in the past 4 days, and like i read here before woman were alot more attractive in these 4 days. I was sceptical about the stories i`ve read so far but when i just started to masturbate i noticed how horny i actually was and how hard i was. 

This stuff actually works!

This did not happen to me in a while, masturbating and porn had became normal and more of a choir instead of something to enjoy. Realizing this has made me more determined to go trough with this and go for the 90 days. I can only imagine what would happen if i went for it and i ended up in bed with my crush! ;)

For myself, I tend to gravitate to games where repetitive actions lead to progress and exploration, if that makes sense.  Having to learn new skills as the game progresses or perform complex, unfamiliar tasks is kind of a no-go on bad days.

A few that have worked for me in the past, in no real order:

Stellaris

The Harvest Moon games/Stardew Valley/Rune Factory

Rebuild 3

The Sims, though lately I find it overwhelming

Spider Solitaire

Turn based RPGs and strategy games in general

Traditional Roguelikes

Euro/American Truck Simulator

2214,"Books have throughout history always been adapted into television shows/movies like Winnie The Pooh, Garfield, A Wrinkle In Time etc.

Which book that has not been previously adapted do you want to see adapted into a television show or movie?

It can be any type of book. As in a novel, a picture book, a short story, a comic book. Any genre- fantasy, non-fiction etc. Any type- children's book etc.

I'll start. I think that Ada Twist Scientist (the children's book) would be a great adaption for PBS and their PBS Kids Programming Block. 

It's modern, very topical and unique children's book. A story about a female kid scientist is very interesting. Lot's of potential episode ideas. I think the show adaptation of the book would do great under the PBS watch.

How about you? What's your pick? Why? Is it because of the characters, the message, the plot? etc.

2234,"Howdy, fine folks! 


This is a really exciting and welcoming community. I love browsing through and seeing all of the positivity, so I thought I'd introduce myself. I'm Holly, I'm in the midst of grad school applications, and I love tea. And I am dancing as I type this! (In the Heights is blasting currently. What music do you guys like?) Tarte is my perennial favorite makeup brand, though I recently fell really hard for NYX. I deleted my OKCupid account the same day I bought a NYX palette, so maybe that says something about my ever-changing whims, I don't know!


Anyway, this community makes me way excited. I have plans. Sneaky plans. Sneaky gifty plans that will come to fruition when I have money. "
2235,"The title doesn't describe it perfectly, I will try to outline what I mean better. Before I found out I was INTP I thought it was just some kind of persistent fantasy I had, usually while caffeinated or after working out. I felt like I had almost a demon/daemon(I don't really believe in either) inside me that was like a dark intense side of me that wanted to get out an wreak havoc, not actually hurt anyone but just unleash some incredible power just to show off almost. 

After learning more about INTP I'm sure its just my repressed Fe trying to show itself, but I'm still trying to analyze it because it doesn't conform to any emotion that I have a name for. I don't know if this will mean anything to anyone but when I try to ""look"" at it, its like a pool of magma under pressure, a seething yellow. Its not anger or malice, its not directed at anyone or as far as I can tell even anything. The closest I can come is it wants to show power or potential so enormous as to inspire awe in people. 

When I am feeling it close to the surface I feel like I could conquer anything I wanted, but the circumstances have to be perfect. I suspect that may be because I know that I really can't do what its telling me, so I don't try because the failure would just ruin the good feeling it gives me.

So am I just a unique 'snowflake' or DAE feel their shadow Fe trying to do the same thing? Is it even something related to being INTP? Any input is appreciated."

Lifestyle change begins 01/2012


http://imgur.com/a/q9eWO


I think there are few words that feel as ugly and awkward as the word obese. Its the kind of word that always follows a sympathetic pause in the presence of the paunchy. It is so round and clinical and weighted down with taciturn lowness that it clings to a person in a way that squeezes and cripples him with what is simultaneously the most formidable and and the most elementary malady for a person to beat. January 5, marked one year since I resolved to change myself.This essay will probably be the most gushing and candid thing I’ve ever written, parts of this may seem attention seeking or boastful but I promise that this comes from the deepest, most sincere, and thought-worn parts of my heart. Its something I’ve had kicking around in my head for the better part of 15 years; this is the eulogy for my obesity.


Size has always dominated me, I began to chub around the fourth grade. I wouldn’t say that I was by any means a too-sad kid but I do think that feeling sad was a trigger for me. As a kid I had a difficult time finding a place where I felt like I was supposed to be. Whenever I would venture a try at something new, I would inevitably leave inadequate. I would feel bitter about being rejected by girls or I would feel sad about not being able to keep up with boys. In response I withdrew and went to food. As I grew up, I never felt right and I never I had anything that was mine with which to excel…I would fantasize about accomplishment and taking ownership of the kind of charisma and strength that would enamour me to those girls and make myself a hero in the minds of those guys, but I had lost so much ground over time that the idea of changing anything was daunting. It felt like my life was looming over me and I used food and humor as a means to swat it.


Gaining weight was mostly gradual with a few sharp spikes. It went on slowly until one day I realized that I was a fat kid and at once the idea got stuck in my head. I remember this feeling of compliance like:""well, this is me now."" As I grew older and boundaries widened, I became heavier. I would ride my bike to the Meijer on Clyde Park when it had a McDonalds in it and I would eat a Double Quarter meal Super-Sized and a twenty-piece chicken nuggets, turn around and ride home. This secret meal would lay on top of everything else I eaten during the day and I would enjoy it with stealth in my mind. It didn’t help that I was also slow to develop socially; I didn't have friends yet and food became music for me. It entertained and occupied me. I would go to movies by myself (which I loved doing) I would devour my lonely popcorn and inhale my propitious Pepsi. With every little bit of freedom I enjoyed, my weight gain would apex and level off. When I got my first job (at a pizza joint) I had tons of free food and money to spend on whatever I liked, when I got my license I could travel farther for different brands and combinations of fast food. Every bit of independance further cemented my habits.


Eventually I did develop a bit of a social lean but I still had a hard time accepting myself to my peers, I always felt like my stature stood between us. For example, one year we went to Michigan Adventure, I hadn’t thought much about the seat in a roller coaster and and never had a problem with a lap bar, but then I got in line for The Corkscrew. We waited eagerly and when the time came I walked up to the cart and looked inside and I thought ""shit."" I sat down next to a friend and it was tight but we were both able to sit. I reach up to pull down the shoulder harness and it wouldn’t click. My chest is too far from my back to get the harness to lock. I want to get out but instead an employee comes to me and tries to help by pressing it into me while I 'suck it in' No dice. I stood up and walked away with all the eyes on my back. I held the ride up and I was that fat kid that didn’t fit so I watched my friends ride the coaster from the sidewalk. It was the first time my size made me feel t isolated in front of someone. My attitude was to quietly tack roller coasters on to a list of things I couldn’t do. Eventually I out grew movie theater seats, airplane seats, and ‘Big & Tall’ sections in the mall and I passively waved goodbye to all of them.


And time just passed by - I built powerful, lasting, and comfortable relationships. I worked and had fun but never really achieved anything. I had quiet goals but all of the things I wanted for myself came to be plain conversational fodder, things you get drunk and dream about out loud. Everything I wanted was so public and everything I was was so private. I wanted to act and I wanted to be a comedian. I did open mics and it left me disgusted and exposed, it was a sort of exhilarating misery that kept you facing the goals you pushed away. I gradually lost momentum and just sort of stalled. Life for a few years was like a room dimly lit by the flickering light of a TV. It was quiet, and private, and comfortable. I remained stealthily obsessed with food. It occupied my mind. The flavors and textures and that feeling of occupation in your core gave me a sense of contentment that was so durable that it became ever-present in my life.


I haven’t always lacked a sense of the need for change. Periodically, I would have manic bouts of conviction and backbone. I would face the world and strive to be social, and better, and healthy. I would purse comedy again, I joined gyms, I sought and gained relationships...complacency though eventually had me back in my room eroding from a habit bordering agoraphobia. Eventually I realized that I wasn’t the possessor friends I once was and I became aware of the cheerlessness I felt for myself and that revealed to me the delicacy of the relationships I had. I was pushing people away from me so that I could revel in my faults. I began to see the folly and futility of so many of the years behind me. I became morbidly mindful of my mortality; I would imagine a roommate finding me dead and how they would react. How my family would react. In that, I realized that I’d lived so absent mindedly for so long that I had become OK with being dead when I was 40 and had subconsciously planned to be alone and idle for whatever time I had left. I’d let indulgence and apathy become intuitive.


A dramatic shift in my mindset came to pass around summer 2011. It was also around this time that I, as none of my friends or family knew, auditioned for a weight loss reality show. On the show, overweight men and women are taken away to a fitness sanctuary where they are taught healthy habits and exercise and exercise and exercise ... it was much like a real-life adult version of the movie Heavyweights. While gone, participants don’t communicate with family or friends and then, after an agonizing and heart lifting episode is complete, they are revealed to friends and family in a new body and attitude. I wanted to be a part of that show and thought I had it. I was interviewed and inline to be a part of the show when, abruptly, the series was put on hold and the new season never materialized.

I was devastated. I had poured my future into this idea that I could be taken away and fixed. That I was going to leave and come back as a new person for everyone to hold up cheer for. I had built up tremendous optimism and lost it all just as quickly. I went right back onto the destructive beat I had just left. Looking back, not making it on that show broke something for me and pushed me to get bad enough that I could get better.


Fortunately it only took about six months, I grieved the loss of my spotlight and my champion transformative moment and during that time reflected soulfully about who I am to the people in my life, who I am to myself, and most importantly recognized that I have it in myself to become the kind of person I want to be: I want to constantly be aware of my potential. I want to be a man that knows and practices right from wrong. I want to modestly inspire goodness, optimism, and effort in people; I want my integrity and my character to be something worth holding up. I want to be external and in the lives of people and I want people to feel that having me in their lives is a thing of value. In order to realize these things I had to accept accountability for what had misrepresented my capability and demeaned my resolve for so long. It wasn’t my weight, it was my attitude about life and an enduring lack of enthusiasm for the future.


I took responsibility for my well being one year ago, I weighed 420 pounds, I wore a XXXXXL dress shirt and 48 jeans. My life and the way I lived it literally changed overnight and hasn’t stumbled. I began by eating a calorie restricted diet and eventually shifted to focus on lower carbohydrates. For exercise I started by walking three miles a day. I would take the bus to school, get off walk a ways and get back on further down the route. Once spring rolled around I began to bike. Those rides progressed from two, to six, to ten mile rides, mostly to and from school. Soon the distance between school and home wasn’t clear or long enough so riding became a purposeful thing rather than utility. I rode and rode. By the end of the summer I had joined the half century club having ridden over fifty miles in one ride. In August I began running using the Couch to 5k program and ran my first full 5k on November 17 and putted along to finish my first 10k on December 15. As of today I have lost 178 pounds, wear a large and 34 jeans. I am stronger and faster than I’ve ever felt myself be. I feel appreciation and optimism in everything that I do and I sense that this is the way life should feel. I’ve still got a lot of work to do but at this point the habits have rooted and the education that I’ve gained over the last year will nurture them. I cannot see my life going backwards, this is who I was always supposed to be.


I’ve spent most of my life planning and daydreaming without action and now everything seems so attainable.This is why I write today, I’m ready to say goodbye to that old life now and to focus on maintaining goal oriented momentum and pushing harder so that the strength in my musings becomes the strength in my character. I can do better, I can do better. I can be the Greatest Man in the World.


Thank you to Mom, my Dad, Jerry, My brothers Eric and Adam, Jessica, Marshall, Corey, Colby; you guys specifically have given me clarity and always been frank with be about delicate things. And to Britt, Allen, Jen, Margie, and Alex, you guys give me the happiness I need to suck it up and do it. This might all seem overly sentimental but I only plan on doing this once and you’ve changed my life in ways that can’t really make sense to you.


Part of the audition process for the reality show I mentioned was to create a series of videos focusing on different aspects of my life. I edited one of them and am keeping a few private, but as for the rest, I don’t see a reason to keep it closeted anymore, I feel like that person is gone now. I uploaded these in May 2011, until now it has been accessible only to the producers of the show. For those interested, I have the links listed below. I think they are a thought-provoking relic.

If there are 2 blogging platforms in one country, the userbase of each may be very ""this site is the best, i love everyone who uses this platform and the other platform sucks"".  

 It's the same in a lot of different types of sites where there is 2 similar competitors. People tend to choose one, then treat it much like a sports fan treats their favorite team.

2244,"Everything is more intense after a few weeks of starting the challenge. The good times are great, and the bad times are shitty. Your brain rewires itself in more ways than one. But like any bad habit, the addiction tries to stick on. Tries to claw itself into your flesh. Desperate is the parasite to survive, to continue feeding. Your mind, starved from it's dopamine source, and sick from years of this poison, will start playing tricks on you. You will constantly think ""one more time won't hurt, I can always start again"", or ""maybe I can edge without coming, that isn't breaking the rules"" or ""looking at these girls without fapping won't do any harm"". BULLSHIT. Any of these things opens the door to a relapse. And when you relapse...that is one of the worst experiences in life (I would know...I relapsed on day 85). 

But when you finally do get through these tests, like Hercules himself completing his labors, your brain will decide to punish you for removing that which it craves so much. It will, for no apparent reason, make you enter a state similar to that of a deep, dark depression.

I remember the (not long ago) moment that this happened to me. Things weren't going that well in my life, and I had just gotten rejected by a girl I wanted to mess around with (I didn't have any feelings for her or anything..which is what made it odd). That was the final straw. I felt like utter crap, as if I  was stuck in a deep black pit with no way out, and no girl on the face of the earth would ever even look my way again.
It was at precisely this moment that I decided that I MUST NOT GIVE UP.
Later on I learned that it is a completely normal part of nofap, called ""flatlining"". But like everything in life, it will come to an end.

“When you get into a tight place and everything goes against you, when it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn.”

Two weeks later, I was feeling much better, and I gathered the courage to go out with the girl I really liked. The whole time I was with her, I really felt like a powerful, successful MAN, looking her in the eyes, not focusing so much on ""oh does she like me? am I doing this right?"", but more on enjoying the moment, while playfully teasing and making fun of her from time to time. It felt great, and even though I still haven't had sex (with her), things are going very well between us, but much more importantly,my confidence is fully restored. But it was only after I decided to get out of that hole, after I decided to rebuild myself, that I had the courage to go for her. Before making that decision, I was truly lost.

Life consists of balance. There will be good times and bad times, no matter what. The best we can do is stay positive, stay disciplined, stay strong, a day at a time. Just take the next step, and the one after that, and eventually you will find that you have climbed the whole mountain.

And if you manage to climb that mountain, survive the challenge, by defeating your enemy temptation with the help of your allies willpower and discipline, a beautiful, great, full, awesome life awaits. This is the life that you truly deserve. Us humans were designed for success, not for failure. It is our birthright to be completely successful and happy, in every aspect of our lives. Living without fapping is a fundamental step in the journey to success and self development.
Stay strong brothers! Do not relapse, and remember, the night is darkest before the dawn!

Just curious what one song, if any, inspired others."
2249,"I released my first e.p last year, which was something i'm quite proud of and sounded exactly like ""me"", exactly like it was in my head at the time of writing the songs, but now it's a different story. I can write songs in the same style as that e.p, but none of them pull me in the same as when i first writ that e.p, when i was doing that i didn't rush it and let it come to me, and when i felt i'd finished the section of the song i was doing i'd bounce it and then find myself constantly listening to it in iTunes, and then i'd suddenly get another spark and add to it. Not long back i said i was gonna start writing an album, and take my time and do it the same way i did the e.p, and so far i've demoed about 6 songs, and none of them interest me at all, even though i'm following the same formula as before, i feel like i've already done it, it's weird to explain, and now i've completely hit the breaking point, any idea i have will turn into shit within half hour of demoing it, but i feel like if i take a break from writing i might lose my creative side, and then when i come back to doing it i'll sound awful. I really just don't know what to do, has anyone got any advice at all?"

I hate it.  I know some people love to go after work because they can sweat out the frustrations of the day, but I feel wiped out by then and have no ""oomph"" when I get there.  I'm just going through the motions, you know?  Sure, I'm getting the lifts done but I'm not enjoying any of it.

Any tips to perk myself up later in the afternoon so I can get through the next few weeks without too much grumbling and whining? >.<"

Does anybody know of any useful books on standup?  They don't necessarily have to be 'how-to' (though I'd expect a lot of them would be), they could be anything relating to some aspect of the field.

I won't file a report. I won't confront the abusers, at least not in the near future. I won't pressure myself to have therapy when I know I don't want to. I won't force myself to talk about the details. I don't need all this.

I will still be careful and I won't give it as a weapon to others. I know I've collected enough supporters to fight off anyone who wants to do me harm. I'm safe and I can live with what I have to live with.

I need people to know, and I need to talk about it like the real experience it was for me. I want to talk about it like talking about the sickness or death of a loved person. I want to talk about it like a horrible car crash. I want to talk about it like it was something that happened, that I couldn't to anything about, and that was horrible.

I might even use it to silence jerks who talk shit about the things I know better because of this. I'm strong enough to take this, and I'm courageous enough to show how scared I get when I talk about it. I'm strong enough to show how weak I get when I think about it. I'm healthy enough to admit how sick it makes me.

I know this powerful feeling will be gone in a few hours, but I'm fixing it here so I can still go on with this plan. I've actually already started a few of the things I mentioned. I'm talking about the subject in general, and I'm freely telling people that my childhood wasn't great, that I've made some really bad experience, and that family members of mine have done things that would have them jailed if I could prove them. Heck, I even told my gynocologist that I've got an anxiety disorder and that he might trigger me and he understood clearly what I was talking about. So why not just call the thing by its name?

I was sexually abused, I was raped, and that's it. It's just another bad, traumatizing story like so many other people have to tell. That's me.

Thank you for reading.

Edit: Thank you all so much, I'm overwhelmed by the reactions.

Just to clarify a few things, since they have been misunderstood a few times - I won't go around babbling ""you know I was raped"" whenever I get the chance. I meant that in conversations that I usually have with others, I won't keep beating around the bush and making up excuses and euphemisms, but instead say the name of the thing. 

To all those people who have made similar experience, I wish you find as much support as you need and I wish you find someone to trust in and talk about it, because it helps so much."

Frodo: ""I can't do this, Sam...""

Sam: ""I know... It's all wrong. By rights we shouldn't even be here... But we are... It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were, and sometimes you didn't want to know the ending, because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened. But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come and when the sun shines it'll shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you, that meant something, even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr Frodo, I do understand... I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only the didn't. They kept going, because they were holding onto something...

Frodo: What are we holding onto, Sam?

Sam: That there's some good in this world, Mr Frodo... And it's worth fighting for."

I loved that component of the story and found the interaction between humanity and aliens very satisfying. What other sf books are out there that deliver in a similar vein? Off the top of my head I think of good examples like The Player of Games, A Fire Upon the Deep, and Embassytown... what are some other ones?

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison

This is the first time I've been below 300 pounds since 1998. I was 400 lbs from 2001-2008. I have never been involved with a man who likes to do physical activity. This is so weird for me and it's a sign of how much I have changed in the last few years, and how much better I feel about myself and how much I love my life now.

2289,"I am conflicted. 

I have one private bed and 5 donation beds at my church community garden. There are about 30 beds in all, and most are privately owned and managed and there is a small monthly fee to keep a bed. The church gave me the empty beds at no charge and the teens and I do all the work and provide the seeds. When we donate, we credit the church.

Apparently, after services yesterday, someone in the church invited the visitors to help themselves to things in the garden. I guess. I don't know this for sure.

As I was walking out to check on my beds, I was at first happy to see so many folks out there thinking it was the owners of the beds and we could chat about our spring plans. But as I got closer, I realized they were all strangers and they were having a field day helping themselves to stuff all over the garden- the private and the donation beds. 

I was kinda torn- I felt like saying ""Hey- who are you people and what are you doing?"" Instead, I said ""hey, are you interested in gardening. These are the private beds and these are the beds we use to donate to the food bank. Two families left immediately, but one guy had his arms just stuffed with things. 

I could see they were damaging the plants by pulling off beans. One guy was pulling cabbages out by the roots with his feet in the bed and damaging the roots of nearby cabbages in the process. A girl was pulling up whole handfuls of carrots and just dropping them on the ground. I said ""Hey, you dropped those carrots"" and she replied ""Well, I don't really like carrots all that much."" I asked ""Why are you picking them then? If you pick them, you need to take them home and eat them."" Her mom came up holding a whole cauliflower plant by the roots. The cauliflower is not producing yet- it didn't even have a small head on it- and told me she was a home-care nurse and wondered how she could get produce for her home-bound clients. I suggested she connect them with the senior program at the food bank or take one of the available beds- ""It's easy and rewarding!"" I said hopefully, but she said she lived too far away.

In the meantime, someone came up behind me and started pulling carrots and onions from my private bed, so I went back and did the same 'these are the private beds and these are the donation beds' schtick.
I dunno. I was just shocked. Who in their right mind would think it proper to just go out to a garden and take away arm-loads of stuff?

Later on in the day, my kids and I went back to survey the damage- carrot carnage: carrots laying everywhere, holes in the ground where whole plants were yanked up, cabbage leaves laying around, broken branches. Half an oregano plant pulled up. Ugh. "

That's really the best way I can put it. It felt like that 'sense of awareness' that I worked hard to attain during the meditation followed me out of the meditation, and I was still observing myself from an unattached state. 

Does this make any sense? I'm really new to this stuff. I googled my symptoms (lol) and depersonalization came up. Is this feeling common for new meditators?"

2295,"[Video at bottom if you would like that first]

Yesterday I competed for the first time at the Florida Regional Yoga Asana Championship. I can honestly say, from my personal perspective, it didn't feel like a competition. 

I had struggled with going and participating for months. I wasn't attracted to the idea of being judged about my practice. However, Friday morning I was on my way and still unsure of even belonging in the competition. The entire weekend was amazing. I stayed in the hotel across the street from the studio that was hosting the competition, and would walk across in the mornings (after getting out of the Jacuzzi of course). The classes were hard, but the people were kind. By Saturday night, I was exhausted and inspired.

Sunday morning @745 I took a class from one of my old teachers that had flew in from Texas for the competition. We showered, and made our way to the auditorium. I expected to see people huddled into their own groups, from their own studios. That was just not the case at all. After working so hard together all weekend, everyone was helping everyone. I hugged strangers, watched their routines for them, calmed them, made them laugh, and many of them did the exact same for me. While practicing my routine on the stage, I must have looked a bit nervous because the gentleman who was practicing next to me reached over and hugged me without saying a word. It helped, I had needed that. He ended up placing first. Such a nice guy. 

[I went on the stage around 4pm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTak2kkUFR8), there were three people after me. It wasn't until I was on stage, and in my pigeon posture in particular that I was comfortable in my own skin on that stage. But in that moment it became clear that I was *supposed* to be exactly where I was.  

The entire experience and response has been amazing, encouraging and inspiring. I have an entirely different outlook on the idea of yoga competition now.

2314,"*I posted on /r/money and it was suggested I post this here so I'm copying/pasting that post here

I come from a really, really low income background. Raised by a single mom who worked a min wage job. No higher ed in our family, everyone I knew ended up in the factory or the military or mostly in jail. Somehow, I escaped this crazy life, worked my ass off in college for 6 years, and just yesterday got offered a job at my dream company with a salary of around 90k. (maybe some of you won't consider this ""riches"" but it is unfathomable to me). The most I have ever made was $1100 a month (what I'm making right now), and when I started this current job I felt I was rolling in cash. No complaints. I love my life and I""m completely comfortable. I have 0 debt and still save.


I am very private about my finances. I live a simple life and I""m very frugal and I feel I make wise decisions. For example, college. I never paid a single dime for college. Through PELL grants, scholarships, and assistanceships, I got out of 6 years of college with 0 debt. The opposite actually. I started working at 15 and now I""m 25 and over those years I've managed to save 30k. No one knows I have this money and it's away in a CD that I started at age 18 that matures every year and I just let it roll over. I've never touched that money and I act like it's not there. I have one credit card which I pay off in full each month. I've never once carried a balance on it. I've never paid my bills late. I've been able to do this because I just don't buy things. There's not a lot I want.


Once I start this job, I don't want to go out and buy a car or a smart phone or things like that. I have an old beater that I paid for in cash years ago that I plan to drive until the wheels fall off. I'm happy with my ghetto $20 /month old flipphone. I don't own a television cus I don't watch TV, and I don't think that'll change. I just don't want stuff like that. But I do have two things I'm interested in doing and I am looking for advice on those


1) My mom is about 60k in debt right now and I want to pay it off for her. SHe's just slave to this debt, she makes so little at her job that she can only make minimum payments and the interest is so much it just never goes away. I haven't told her i""m gonna pay it off yet (I haven't even told her I got offered the job). Is it best to just pay it all at once? How do I do it? Luckily for me I set her up on all online accounts recently so I have access to all her accounts and could do it in secrecy.


2) I am wondering if I should buy a condo. The one big money dream I guess I always had was owning a piece of property, but I don't want a house. If I buy a condo I could either live in it myself or rent it out I suppose. I'm just trying to figure out if that's something that's feasible with a 90k salary in California, or if it's wise because the real estate market is so shitty and what not. My other option is I can just rent an apartment. Here's the thing though, I have lived in the hood pretty much my whole life. I just don't even want to live in some big fancy apartment. So if I rent an apartment, I'm just gonna look for another cheap place in a crappy neighborhood. I don't know why. Maybe that's what I know and that's where I feel comfortable. So given that this is my alternative, is it wiser to invest, or just stick with a shitty apt in a shitty neighborhood?


Other than that does anyone have any advice? SHould I hire a financial consultant (do those exist for individuals, are they worth it?) Or an accountant of some sort? I grew up below the poverty line, I'm still under it now, and pretty much everyone I know is. So I Just can't ask them for advice. I just don't know what to do with that much money. There are only 8 pairs of clothes in my closet, I only have two pairs of shoes. I can't comprehend this yet. Do you know any good books that can help me out? Are there any common mistakes people make when they first make money? I feel I know the basics - when I got my CD years ago I read about IRAs and 401k and stuff like that. SHould I Just go crazy and get it all - or should I Just keep adding to my CD?

Thanks guys, have a great weekend"

It lathers nicely, you get a lot of lather for a small amount, especially if you use one of those loofah sponges, or body-puffs or whatever. It's nice lather too, not as creamy as some body washes, but still nice. Gets you nice and clean :)

2325,"I recently moved across country and bought a new house.  My woodworking tools of course came with me, where they share a garage with a car.  I'm looking for advice for how I should lay out / set up the garage to be the most effective.  I've got about a bay and a half of space.

[Pics of the garage in the post-move state](http://imgur.com/a/inw6p)

So, there is some existing wood up against one wall, (and the plywood is blocking access to outlets, including a 240V.  Also, there is a load-bearing post in the middle of my space.  I'm planning on getting some roller-bases (HTC2000, most likely) for the table saw and jointer, which should give me much more flexibility.

I need to build a work bench as well, as I don't have one here.  I'd like input on how large to make it, and where to place it.  While I'd love to be able to have a free-standing one, a good one would be a bit heavy to move around.  I may just have to make one that sits against a wall.

2328,"I am a musician and have played for a few larger churches for about 8 years now. Most songs we play are mainstream worship.  I understand it is meant to be simple so people can ""lose themselves in worship,"" but does every song on Christian radio have to be a simple worship song or a cheesy ""sunshiny"" song that was recorded 10+ years ago?  I feel this only encourages the Christian bubble and the illusion of Christians having no emotions but ""positive and encouraging.""  Where are songs about struggle or real life?  Life isn't shiny.  It's a struggle.  It's a race. Why not meet people where they are and maybe have a higher standard for music than the same 4 chord songs we have been writing for the last couple decades?"

3. Dune.

4. 1984
     An important and always relevent perspective on a myriad of issues
     
5. The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.
     Intricately written and still relatable after 100 years

2336,"**EDIT: Aaron's name is Aaron Swartz, not Schwartz. The mistake is mine - OrangePlus.**

Yesterday, we the mods of /r/technology, along with the rest of the Reddit and Internet communities became aware of the tragic suicide of Aaron Swartz. Aaron's short life became emblematic of the struggle for the free availability of information, dissemination of information and the formation of an activism for that freedom. We will, in the future, encounter circumstances when government or business interests attempt to stifle the free flowing of information and expression, where we will miss his creativity and bravery. While we cannot know for certain why he took the action he did, it has been said that this was a direct result of the price he was being made to pay in his effort to secure those freedoms.

We may not have all or always agreed with the way he fought his fights, but we respect the sentiment behind them. We will remember him for those tangible aspects of the efforts he contributed to, including the RSS standard, Demand Progress and of course, Reddit itself.

While we share in the grief of many, and the concerns highlighted by his death, we must maintain the smooth functioning of this subreddit. We have decided to make this one post and ask that all further posts concerning Aaron be made as comments here. We will be removing the many reposts and asking the posters to send them here.

Yesterday there was confusion amongst the mods of /r/technology on policy for links about his death. This resulted in many links being removed while others were allowed. We apologize for this confusion and any inconvenience it has caused our users.

2337,"I posted this on r/guitarlessons, but perhaps I will get a bigger responce here.

A brief recap on my guitar journey so far:

•So I started playing guitar 13 years ago. I spent the first year taking lessons from a guy who was able to teach me Ode To Joy and Yanki Doodle. 

•I took a 6 month break and then took lessons from a really good acoustic finger picker who had a huge collection of his own arrangements of Chet Akins, The Beatles, and ect...
 
•In the mean time I spent many hours trying to play Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Van Halen..ect...

•I played in a couple of bands during high school, by the time I was 18 I had found a couple of good guys to play with and we sounded pretty good. But that has long since disolved itself and I have not found any musicians to jam with since.

•My theory is is strong up until the harmonization level. I took theory while studying the trumpet in high school.

•Last year I grew tired of rock (and roll) and moved to a folk. I have since been playing Gordon Light Foot, Jim Croce, America, Cat Stevens, ect...I don't have a great voice it is not that enjoyable.

After a lot of thought, about a week ago I decided to do a 360 and go back to the beginning. 

Why?

There is a saying that after 10,000 hours, one can master a skill. I have put in my 10,000 hours and yet feel guilty calling my self a guitarist sometimes. If a song isn't played on a Am-Dm progression I can't solo to it. My ability to play chords is restriced to maj, min, and the 7ths. I only know the pentatonic minor scale. I don't know what notes are what on the fret board. I really feel like I have failed at this insturment.

But I don't want to give up. I have invested too much time and money into this...my passion is with music...I know I have a good understanding of what it is that Im doing, I just don't know how to apply it to the insturment.

I went to the local music store last monday and bought a scale book. I have put in about 5-6 hours since Tuesday and have since memorized the main 6 variations to do a double octive Amajor scale and can play them in 16th at 94 tempo. (pathetic that after 13 years I just learnt how to do a major scale on the guitar).

But I was thinking this morning...what if I approach this wrong..what if another 13 years go by and still know nothing....

My question to you is a mash of: What path do I take. How can I become comfertable with the guitar? How does one approach scales and chords? 

Any comment is greatly appreciated...even if you just want to tell me that Im a fool for wasting 13 years and should shoot myself.

2345,"I started hunching on stuff and then fapping to climax before grade school.  Wasn't related to sex at all. It just felt good especially at the end.  By the time left grade school i had found my dads and granddads stashes and it naturally became about women..even before I knew about sex. (Published Porn back in the day didnt involve couples or genitals.) Then i hit puberty. It was still awhile before I understood what that goo was.  Faping was as normal as anything else i did. The kid across the street and I would fap in the same room with porn i had stolen from my grand dad, no shame. It has consistently crippled my life since then. THAT I feel guilty about. Now nearly 60 years later i am my nth attempt to no fap.  My wife and I are both sick of it and I am really counting on my brain being elastic because this is really hard.  She asks me why she should believe me this time and I told her there is no reason she should but knowing the physical reasons for all of this gives me hope....things are changing in me even if I dont feel any different.  She is strongly considering leaving me and frankly if she wasn't dependant economically I thinks she would be gone.   I get no emotional, intimacy or sex support from her and that makes it tougher but it also makes it my fight.  Not something I am doing for anybody else.   Back to why I have hope and confidence this time...because this forum has taught me that it is not abnormal to be in this place.  When I think about it, when those triggers are fired..i make the choice to hit my nofap favorite and am supported, strengthened and even chemically rewarded with your posts. Thanks to all of you.  "

Also Pink Floyd's Animals album is largely influenced by [Animal Farm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm) by George Orwell.

2396,"My snow blower and my wife's netbook both broke this winter, and I was on the verge of replacing both of them at a pretty high cost.

Instead, for $44 and $10 respectively I fixed both today.

The snow blower carburetor was all gummed up and even though I cleaned it and had a ""professional"" work on it, it just wouldn't hold a load and would chock out all the time.

It seems that most snow blowers use the same carburetor so I found one on ebay for $44, and it arrived today.

5 screws and a fuel line later, I was throwing snow like a mad man!

For the netbook, the CPU fan was making a screeching noise you wouldn't believe.

A $10 internet find, 15 tiny little screws later and she's running like a champ once again, quiet as ever!

Anyway, I'm proud of my frugality and my handy-ness skills and wanted to share.

I think there are few words that feel as ugly and awkward as the word obese. Its the kind of word that always follows a sympathetic pause in the presence of the paunchy. It is so round and clinical and weighted down with taciturn lowness that it clings to a person in a way that squeezes and cripples him with what is simultaneously the most formidable and and the most elementary malady for a person to beat. January 5, marked one year since I resolved to change myself.This essay will probably be the most gushing and candid thing I’ve ever written, parts of this may seem attention seeking or boastful but I promise that this comes from the deepest, most sincere, and thought-worn parts of my heart. Its something I’ve had kicking around in my head for the better part of 15 years; this is the eulogy for my obesity.


Size has always dominated me, I began to chub around the fourth grade. I wouldn’t say that I was by any means a too-sad kid but I do think that feeling sad was a trigger for me. As a kid I had a difficult time finding a place where I felt like I was supposed to be. Whenever I would venture a try at something new, I would inevitably leave inadequate. I would feel bitter about being rejected by girls or I would feel sad about not being able to keep up with boys. In response I withdrew and went to food. As I grew up, I never felt right and I never I had anything that was mine with which to excel…I would fantasize about accomplishment and taking ownership of the kind of charisma and strength that would enamour me to those girls and make myself a hero in the minds of those guys, but I had lost so much ground over time that the idea of changing anything was daunting. It felt like my life was looming over me and I used food and humor as a means to swat it.


Gaining weight was mostly gradual with a few sharp spikes. It went on slowly until one day I realized that I was a fat kid and at once the idea got stuck in my head. I remember this feeling of compliance like:""well, this is me now."" As I grew older and boundaries widened, I became heavier. I would ride my bike to the Meijer on Clyde Park when it had a McDonalds in it and I would eat a Double Quarter meal Super-Sized and a twenty-piece chicken nuggets, turn around and ride home. This secret meal would lay on top of everything else I eaten during the day and I would enjoy it with stealth in my mind. It didn’t help that I was also slow to develop socially; I didn't have friends yet and food became music for me. It entertained and occupied me. I would go to movies by myself (which I loved doing) I would devour my lonely popcorn and inhale my propitious Pepsi. With every little bit of freedom I enjoyed, my weight gain would apex and level off. When I got my first job (at a pizza joint) I had tons of free food and money to spend on whatever I liked, when I got my license I could travel farther for different brands and combinations of fast food. Every bit of independance further cemented my habits.


Eventually I did develop a bit of a social lean but I still had a hard time accepting myself to my peers, I always felt like my stature stood between us. For example, one year we went to Michigan Adventure, I hadn’t thought much about the seat in a roller coaster and and never had a problem with a lap bar, but then I got in line for The Corkscrew. We waited eagerly and when the time came I walked up to the cart and looked inside and I thought ""shit."" I sat down next to a friend and it was tight but we were both able to sit. I reach up to pull down the shoulder harness and it wouldn’t click. My chest is too far from my back to get the harness to lock. I want to get out but instead an employee comes to me and tries to help by pressing it into me while I 'suck it in' No dice. I stood up and walked away with all the eyes on my back. I held the ride up and I was that fat kid that didn’t fit so I watched my friends ride the coaster from the sidewalk. It was the first time my size made me feel t isolated in front of someone. My attitude was to quietly tack roller coasters on to a list of things I couldn’t do. Eventually I out grew movie theater seats, airplane seats, and ‘Big & Tall’ sections in the mall and I passively waved goodbye to all of them.


And time just passed by - I built powerful, lasting, and comfortable relationships. I worked and had fun but never really achieved anything. I had quiet goals but all of the things I wanted for myself came to be plain conversational fodder, things you get drunk and dream about out loud. Everything I wanted was so public and everything I was was so private. I wanted to act and I wanted to be a comedian. I did open mics and it left me disgusted and exposed, it was a sort of exhilarating misery that kept you facing the goals you pushed away. I gradually lost momentum and just sort of stalled. Life for a few years was like a room dimly lit by the flickering light of a TV. It was quiet, and private, and comfortable. I remained stealthily obsessed with food. It occupied my mind. The flavors and textures and that feeling of occupation in your core gave me a sense of contentment that was so durable that it became ever-present in my life.


I haven’t always lacked a sense of the need for change. Periodically, I would have manic bouts of conviction and backbone. I would face the world and strive to be social, and better, and healthy. I would purse comedy again, I joined gyms, I sought and gained relationships...complacency though eventually had me back in my room eroding from a habit bordering agoraphobia. Eventually I realized that I wasn’t the possessor friends I once was and I became aware of the cheerlessness I felt for myself and that revealed to me the delicacy of the relationships I had. I was pushing people away from me so that I could revel in my faults. I began to see the folly and futility of so many of the years behind me. I became morbidly mindful of my mortality; I would imagine a roommate finding me dead and how they would react. How my family would react. In that, I realized that I’d lived so absent mindedly for so long that I had become OK with being dead when I was 40 and had subconsciously planned to be alone and idle for whatever time I had left. I’d let indulgence and apathy become intuitive.


A dramatic shift in my mindset came to pass around summer 2011. It was also around this time that I, as none of my friends or family knew, auditioned for a weight loss reality show. On the show, overweight men and women are taken away to a fitness sanctuary where they are taught healthy habits and exercise and exercise and exercise ... it was much like a real-life adult version of the movie Heavyweights. While gone, participants don’t communicate with family or friends and then, after an agonizing and heart lifting episode is complete, they are revealed to friends and family in a new body and attitude. I wanted to be a part of that show and thought I had it. I was interviewed and inline to be a part of the show when, abruptly, the series was put on hold and the new season never materialized.

I was devastated. I had poured my future into this idea that I could be taken away and fixed. That I was going to leave and come back as a new person for everyone to hold up cheer for. I had built up tremendous optimism and lost it all just as quickly. I went right back onto the destructive beat I had just left. Looking back, not making it on that show broke something for me and pushed me to get bad enough that I could get better.


Fortunately it only took about six months, I grieved the loss of my spotlight and my champion transformative moment and during that time reflected soulfully about who I am to the people in my life, who I am to myself, and most importantly recognized that I have it in myself to become the kind of person I want to be: I want to constantly be aware of my potential. I want to be a man that knows and practices right from wrong. I want to modestly inspire goodness, optimism, and effort in people; I want my integrity and my character to be something worth holding up. I want to be external and in the lives of people and I want people to feel that having me in their lives is a thing of value. In order to realize these things I had to accept accountability for what had misrepresented my capability and demeaned my resolve for so long. It wasn’t my weight, it was my attitude about life and an enduring lack of enthusiasm for the future.


I took responsibility for my well being one year ago, I weighed 420 pounds, I wore a XXXXXL dress shirt and 48 jeans. My life and the way I lived it literally changed overnight and hasn’t stumbled. I began by eating a calorie restricted diet and eventually shifted to focus on lower carbohydrates. For exercise I started by walking three miles a day. I would take the bus to school, get off walk a ways and get back on further down the route. Once spring rolled around I began to bike. Those rides progressed from two, to six, to ten mile rides, mostly to and from school. Soon the distance between school and home wasn’t clear or long enough so riding became a purposeful thing rather than utility. I rode and rode. By the end of the summer I had joined the half century club having ridden over fifty miles in one ride. In August I began running using the Couch to 5k program and ran my first full 5k on November 17 and putted along to finish my first 10k on December 15. As of today I have lost 178 pounds, wear a large and 34 jeans. I am stronger and faster than I’ve ever felt myself be. I feel appreciation and optimism in everything that I do and I sense that this is the way life should feel. I’ve still got a lot of work to do but at this point the habits have rooted and the education that I’ve gained over the last year will nurture them. I cannot see my life going backwards, this is who I was always supposed to be.


I’ve spent most of my life planning and daydreaming without action and now everything seems so attainable.This is why I write today, I’m ready to say goodbye to that old life now and to focus on maintaining goal oriented momentum and pushing harder so that the strength in my musings becomes the strength in my character. I can do better, I can do better. I can be the Greatest Man in the World.


Thank you to Mom, my Dad, Jerry, My brothers Eric and Adam, Jessica, Marshall, Corey, Colby; you guys specifically have given me clarity and always been frank with be about delicate things. And to Britt, Allen, Jen, Margie, and Alex, you guys give me the happiness I need to suck it up and do it. This might all seem overly sentimental but I only plan on doing this once and you’ve changed my life in ways that can’t really make sense to you.


Part of the audition process for the reality show I mentioned was to create a series of videos focusing on different aspects of my life. I edited one of them and am keeping a few private, but as for the rest, I don’t see a reason to keep it closeted anymore, I feel like that person is gone now. I uploaded these in May 2011, until now it has been accessible only to the producers of the show. For those interested, I have the links listed below. I think they are a thought-provoking relic.

2401,"I was sucked into the book fairly quickly. I was excited that he presented the mystery of the derelict fleet, the humanoid corpse named Herbie, and I was looking forward to the diverse alien species that were bound to arrive at the planet and try to capture the main characters.

I felt like the narrative was fairly descriptive of the planet, the way that dolphins interacted with humans and the starship, but from a plot point of view I felt like the middle of the book was essentially crew politics.

the last third of the novel seemed to be more interesting to me: all the maneuvers of the Streaker starship, the smaller dolphin ship, and the galactic alien fleets that were hoping to capture them.

my favorite aspect about the entire novel was most definitely the poetic dolphin communications.  

I also found the various religious and cosmological / world view of the dolphins and different races very entertaining.  

my question is: in what books do you find out about the significance of Herbie and the derelict fleet?

"
2402,"Other time frames are acceptable, the only caveat is you can only use current technology. So set up an experiment today and monitor it for X years where X is an arbitrarily large time frame."
2403,"If this sounds ridiculous, I concede it is probably due to my ignorance of genetics and CRISPR's capabilities in that domain.  Sorry about that, but please educate me!  But the reason I ask is because a) we allow animal testing that we wouldn't allow for humans, and b) while the application of sapience to produce abstract knowledge-based intelligence over generations may be largely environmental, sapience itself is largely genetic, right?  And once the genetic/structural aspects are accounted for, shouldn't humans be able to train animals *how* to think abstractly?

Sapience may be genetically complex, but so are holistic aims like reversing the aging process.  At least sapience is confined to a single organ, and we have a good starting point in contrasting the genetics of humans from those of other primates.

Anyhow, I know that's a sloppy argument; I'm really just asking the question.  Is it reasonable to expect CRISPR to dramatically change opportunities for currently non-sapient animals both prior to and more dramatically than the changes to human opportunities?

Edit: Thanks for the great answers!"

2410,"Since I had a day off today I decided to chuck 3 movies into my day. I started off with Demolition w/ Jake Gyllenhaal which was good, very sad but peculiar tone overall. Then after I watched Logan after putting it off for so long. 

Halfway through I got this great idea to watch Prisoners, it’s got Jackman, Gyllenhaal, AND the added bonus of Dano. On top of that it’s a Denis Villeneuve film which sold me on the idea. But I watched it when it first came out and remembered how depressing the ending was (and pretty much the whole story) but as soon as I reached the end of Logan it was clear my quota on depressing movies was filled for the day so I’m looking for something else to watch.

Any suggestions are fine as long as they are not actually sad. I would accept Swiss Army Man for example cause as depressing as it is, you feel chipper throughout (mostly) the whole thing."

2413,"A little over a month ago I found this subreddit and took up my new years resolution to learn to program and eventually make a game.  You guys helped me get my feet wet and find a starting point.  

I decided to learn python and completed the Code Academy classes in a few weeks then did the book linked in the subreddit faqs.  

I had the idea at work yesterday to write a program that could take in a word search field and then find any word you asked it to, on all directions, and then give back which row you could find the word.

I know there are much more elegant ways of doing it but I solved the problem by writing strings of each row, then reordering the strings to check for vertical and horizontal words (even reversing the key word in case they exist in the field backwards).

I finished it and it works as intended.  Even fool proofed the data input (mostly).  Also wrote it so it can take any size field (field size isn't hard coded).  It really feels great to have come up with my own challenge and then have the capability to complete that challenge (and in a way better than I expected).

So thanks /r/learnprogramming you got me off to a great start.  

Next step is Pygame and graphical coding."

I'm thinking planet built from the ground up (with a different chemical composition, not just Earth 2.1), evolution, and weird ""animals"" at the end of it that are just humans with a different shade of color and horns. I'm sure there has been some sort of bored biology professor who wants to really dig into an alien world, I just don't know where to start.

Ever since writing fanfiction for SPN (I started about 1.5 years ago), my confidence in writing has skyrocketed with so many awesome anonymous reviews - just complete strangers - telling me that my writing was browsed, selected, and read for pure entertainment. People have read 50k+ stories of mine all the way through and said it was awesome. It's amazing. So, as a result, within the next two weeks I'm planning on self-publishing my own original short story. I'm not expecting much, obviously, as I feel like I'm a dime a dozen in terms of self-publishing writers, but the fandom gave me the confidence for it - so I can't thank you guys enough for that.

I want to know how to find that special something that makes my life feel worthwhile and that I feel I want to spend my time doing, be it a career path or hobby.

I have a job (in retail) but I don't enjoy it and I want to pursue a career but I have no idea what in. No denying I'm good at my current job, but anybody who is able to interact with people and has some common sense can be good at working in retail, and I find it a little hard to believe that this is my only skill.

I have no hobbies to speak of, unless you count mindlessly surfing the web or watching TV, and I don't have many friends. I don't drink alcohol so I find socialising with my age group a little difficult. I can't sing or play an instrument and I am not in any way artistic or creative.

I have no academic qualifications either, despite spending 3 years attempting to gain some college qualifications (not university qualifications, I am from the UK). I want to go to university as I feel I missed out on the experience and the chance to learn something and improve my chances. But once again, after spending hours and hours researching universities and the courses available, I cannot find a single thing I want to spend 3 years learning and getting myself into debt for.


**tl;dr:** How on Earth do I find something I want to do with my life? Or do I just suck it up and accept that I'll be stuck in a dead end job forever and that I am essentially a very very boring person?"

2439,"I was always the skinny kid, always ate whatever I wanted never gained any weight.  Worked out here and there and never got anything from it so never really continued (I was impatient).  Finally got a membership at a good gym and got a buddy to help me get started.  Finally happy about not being the skinny kid after a year, but still looking for a little more.  [Progress Pic](http://i.imgur.com/9cJvBg8.png) Additional after back [PIC](http://i.imgur.com/peke1un.jpg) sorry I don't have a before.

I was told to post this here for you guys.

I'm 23 y/o, 6 ft 2 inches


Skinny Picture I was around 155
After picture I weighed in at 184.  


Food wise:
Being the kid who could stay skinny no matter what I ate I took to the food route.  Eat as much High Protein stuff as I can (try to be clean stuff). Lean chicken and turkey can be your best friend.  I make a salsa chicken in the crock pot all the time.  Pretty cheap and easy. 
* 2lbs of chicken
* 10oz can of creme of chicken soup
* 16oz jar/can of salsa
Mix the two cans together pour over the chicken and cook on low for 6ish hours.  Shred the chicken and put back into crockpot, add 2 spoonfuls of sour cream to the mix and eat.  Its great over rice, by itself or with totilla chips.


The only Supplement I added was a protein shake after I worked out. None of that fancy super fancy stuff just some cheap stuff from [GNC](http://www.gnc.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3267268&cp=3593187.2108294), only $50 for a 5lb container with around 71 servings (one scoop) I usually took two scoops/


Basic routine breakdown.
**Monday**
Chest exercises 
**Tuesday**
Back and Shoulders
**Wednesday**
Legs
**Thursday**
Random stuff I felt like working more on that week.
**Friday Saturday Sunday**
These were usually rest days, but sometimes I would go in and do some stuff still, and sometimes start the week over early depending on how I felt.


I can't really tell you exercises I did cause it changed a lot along with the big stuff that everyone knows for each muscle group.  When you get bored of what you're doing look up videos online of the muscle group your going to work out next and do those exercises you don't always do.


Find a friend to help you when you get started.  I got lucky and had a buddy who was a football player for a small college who was will to work out with the weak kid and got me started.  It also gives you a great reason to keep going if you have someone that will make you go.


The biggest thing it takes is persistence, keep working even when you think you're not getting anywhere.  Change stuff up and continue to try new exercises."

2452,"This year I am honoured to have been nominated as the chess captain of my high-school. Unfortunately, the entire school body (including the teachers) believe that chess has been wrongly categorised as a sport and thus deserves to be treated with contempt and open hostility. It is now at the point where students are too embarrassed to try out for a chess team due to the unbelievably negative effect that this has on their reputation and respect amongst their peers.

As a result of the animosity towards chess in the school the only people left to try out for the teams are the 'nerds' (for lack of a better term) who are so unpopular and socially removed that they are unaware of the hate they are receiving. Of course, this makes chess look even worse to the regular members of the school, thus snow-balling the problem to the point that regular people will not even consider trying out to make a chess team. To top it all off, these 'nerds' are very poor players (they would be lucky to scrape 800 elo) and for this reason it is very rare for our college to win the annual inter-school competition.

With this in mind I need to give a speech that motivates the regular students at the school to consider chess as a practical and entertaining co-curricular sport. I have encouraged a couple of good chess players (who are also normal people) to try out this year and I hope this may assist in my promotion of the sport. Given my experience at the school, I have noted the following things about acceptance speeches:

- puns and jokes are strictly off limit. The chess captain last year attempted this and was crucified (respect-wise) by the school.

- the most successful speech ever given was by the captain of the rugby union team who parodied the 'I have a dream' speech of Martin Luther King, Jr. 

- famous quotes are commonplace but a lot of people are becoming bored with their repetition.

- it may be best to acknowledge that chess is not a traditional 'sport' in an athletic sense but that does not mean that it is not enjoyable.

Anyway, this is no doubt a difficult task. I'm not expecting an entire speech (although this would be ideal), however lines, ideas or paragraphs that I could include would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance."

So what I've been doing? Honestly, mostly calorie counting. I naturally reduced my carb intake over time and I haven't eaten bread on months now, but most of it is pure, basic calorie counting. I'm nowhere near keto, I'm not even low carb, I'm just lower carb than I used to be.

As for how many calories, I started out at 2200 for a week or so, dropped it to 2000 and then to 1800 soon after. After a while, I further dropped it to 1600 and that's my upper limit now. Practically speaking, I usually hang around 1400 these days, mostly because I don't have the appetite for more.

During the warmer days, I also ran (hilly terrain, so not really jogging), but I haven't been very active during the winter, other than some minor weight lifting. Now that it's finally getting warmer again, I plan to up my activity by a lot and lose the last few pounds I need in the first half of this year.

As for the numbers, I started out at around 440 lbs and I'm at 210 now. I'm 185cm tall (don't feel like finding a calculator now, but that's about 6.1 I think), so I should probably lose 10-20 lbs still, depending on how much muscle I plan to put on (and I do plan to put on muscle). I've been losing 20+ a month when I started and this has been steadily dropping. Now I lose about 6-8 lbs a month, and it's not as linear as it used to be, but I have yet to experience a plateau longer than 2 and a half weeks.

Other than that, my health has been great. I got basically cured of hypertensia, though I'm still getting off the pills (slowly reducing the dosage), my hormones got rebalanced and my heart is now in the nice 50-70 bpm range (it used to be 110-130). Everything is just great.

If you have more questions, feel free to ask. LoseIt helped me a lot, so I'd like to return the favor.

EDIT: Thanks for the kind words! I'm sorry I'm not responding to every comment, but I'm at work now, so I thought I should focus on answering the questions first. The support I'm getting here makes me feel awesome."

2482," I'm new to MWO, but, as I grew up playing MW2 & MW4, I made the foolish assumption that it'd be OK jump into this game without doing much research. For some reason I thought a CPLT-C4 LRM boat would be a good starting mech. 

 This is what I built:

 STD 260 (default)
 DHS (w/ zero extra HS... *facepalm*)
 (ARTEMIS IV)
 AMS x 1
 -1000 rounds ammo
 C.A.S.E x 2 

 MPULS - 2x
 LRM15 - 2x
 -900 rounds ammo


 I can usually do OK (and sometimes quite well) in this build (if the opposing team has little to no ECM), but it's kind of useless in a lot of situations, and, even worse... its boring to play. In contrast, the Trial AS7-D is really fun and the playstyle is familiar (extreme focused-firepower, primarily short-range).

 Because I wanted to support the game and farm more efficiently, I also bought a CTF-IM (Ilya Muromets). I've been playing with this in the default config while I save up the money for an overhaul. While the default config can feel weak at times, I enjoy it a lot more than my CPLT-C4, and I'm excited to try out some LBX/10 and Gauss builds when I have more money (2.5m at the time of writing this).


 So I have a number of questions about this situation:

 - Am I giving up on the C4 too quickly? I've decided I don't want to play an LRM boat, but I haven't tried the SRM / SSRM Cat. yet. Also, I may want a CPLT-K2 with Mastery some day..
 - If I give up on the C4, should I sell it now to get a new mech ASAP? Or just wait until I run out of garage space?
 - I'm thinking I could replace the C4 with a Centurion or a Hunchback. Any advice? Should I be particularly concerned about which chassis I want to attain Mastery in right now?


Thanks for reading!"

2484,"What exactly is the best term for the opposite of free will? By free will, I mean more casual indeterminism, a philosophy espoused by Robert Kane. Quite simply, I mean the ability to determine your own fate, the belief that human action is a choice and there are alternatives to our choices and actions.

My question is, what is the best term for the antihesis of this? I find Determinism inadequate because it's such a big tent that includes nomological determinism, which doesn't necessarily negate casual indeterminism. Hard determinism seems to be the best phrase I've found thus far, but it is associated nomological determinism. Fatalism isn't exactly the term I'm looking for, because that's associated with theological determinism. 

Essentially, I'm asking what would be the best phrase that holds individuals are incapable of truly having free will and thus decisions should be made for them? "

I've completed the steps, have a sponsee now, speak at meetings, have got my shit together, and dreams are coming true in a very literal sense. I have a great job, great friends, I wake up bright and early every day now, I am pursuing my hobbies with a passion and life is getting better and better. 

My message is simple - you can do this. Before I came here and to AA I was drinking daily about a 12 pack, every day after work, and all day during the weekends. I had zero friends, my family was worried about me, I had been diagnosed with Rosacia on my face because it was all red and swollen, and I was about 30 pounds over weight. I had high blood pressure, my toes tingled in the morning, I would dry heave into the sink when I woke up, and I wanted to die. I just could not fathom living any longer the way I had been living, but I also didn't want to face my demons, and my problems. 

Well, fuck all of that. That's no way to live, so I finally manned up and got a badge and a sponsor in AA. It works, at least it has for me. 

Anyway, I just want to check in since it's been awhile. I still lurk often but usually before bed on my iPad so I can't easily reply to posts. I do read them, and all of you have helped keep me sober. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for all you have done for me!! "

Would you say that people are good climbers when they climb over a certain threshold of difficulty? Is the definition of ""good climber"" about strength or skill? For instance, ""A good climber is one that can boulder at least V5 and climb at least 5.11d."" 

Or is it something more than that? Is it about climbing gracefully or smoothly? Could someone who can only boulder V1 and climb 5.8 still be a ""good climber"" because they are particularly graceful?

2519,"Hi guys,

My first ever post on Reddit, so please be gentle.

I'm just looking for a bit of work related advice. I've been depressed (undiagnosed) for a long while now, mainly because of family issues, however this has been affecting my work for a while now, through attendance issues, to the point where I am taking enough time off work to be invited to an interview about it...

*EDIT* - Attendance issues related to depression causing lack of sleep and becoming run down, getting ill, etc... (just to clarify)

I've had an interview about it previously, and I just broke down in front of them, crying and all that shit, really wasn't nice and i'm extremely concerned its going to happen again. The interview is informal and is basically a ""how are you, can we help"" style do... but as soon as someone asks that question, I just can't help but become overwhelmed with emotion/anxiety/frustration etc...

I'm scared of doctors, mainly because of things that have happened in the past with me, in my childhood, so i just have a stupid, irrational fear of them, plus my doctor isn't great... I also really don't like the idea of medication to fix me, i've seen where it takes some people and i'm not ready for that...

I don't know what to do, but I want to avoid this meeting, i'm happy to do whatever they want, I just don't want to be in the situation where someone is asking me how I am, because I just can't handle it.

Do I have any kind of employee rights or whatever, to ask if we can conduct the interview differently, if I can just do whatever it is they are going to ask me to do, or anything that avoids being confronted and asked the question?

Help! Sorry! :("

2522,"Last year I was hurt very badly by some people in my life, and one in particular was a very bad friend for a very long time. It's difficult to do, but cutting those people out of my life has lead me to being so much happier. 

I realised, I don't deserve people who make me feel like shit, I don't deserve people who don't value me, and they don't deserve any of my time and energy. 

They've since tried to apologise for their behaviour, and other friends have tried to encourage me to forgive them and reconnect with them. But I refuse to. I have some amazing people in my life who far more deserve my attention. 

I now realise these people were a huge source of some of my anxiety and cutting them off has gone a long way towards finding some stability. 

Don't be afraid to shut the door on those who don't deserve you! "

2528,"I recently listened to a [really excellent episode](http://www.radiolab.org/story/update-crispr/) of the podcast Radiolab that discusses CRISPR, a technique for editing genes.  

The thing that made the episode so interesting is that this one was basically an update of and update of an original episode that aired some years ago.  

I encourage everyone to listen, but the short version is that recent developments in a technique called ""gene drive"" have opened the theoretical door for self-perpetuating gene editing, and the potential for small groups or even individuals to modify genes in embryos - genes which may then alter entire populations over generations, with or without human control or consent.

Don't know if there are any stories out there that deal with that sort of thing, but if there aren't... there should be."

I'm a new player and this is my first game, so bear with me if I don't know anything obvious. Right now I'm of course trying to expand towards the left, seen in the picture. However, it also happens to be a void of habitable planets. I found a primitive civilization, but they have nearly opposite ethos of mine, so I didn't really want to uplift them. This means I have to keep building frontier outposts in order to maintain my borders. Is there any way to maintain my borders without influence cost?

And an additional question - I am on pacifist-fanatic spiritualist (the ""Yondar"" preset), and I'm not sure which of the hostile aliens I can kill without penalties or not. Someone please help?"
2532,"So I am trying to rekindle the love I had for Stellaris when it first came out. But I feel like I'm falling far behind in my current play through because I started with only 3 nearby habitable planets, where as all my closest neighbors started with 5-7. I've found another 60% habitability world, but thought I'd ask what you pro's do with poor starts like this. Is the investment in terraforming worth it given the circumstances? I'm in an elective democratic form of government so I can only control 3 planets directly anyways...

For those that suggest starting again with 'adaptive' and what not, I feel that's a little like cheating, because I am trying to role play a little, so I don't really want to do that.

Thanks for any suggestion!"

*Leviathan Wakes* - seems a little fluffy and YAish but fun. 

*Revelation Space* - I've heard it's super dark and inspired the Mass Effect series, both things that intrigue me. 

*Gateway* - love old school SF and I've never read any Pohl.

*Seveneves* - heard mixed things but the plot seems interesting. I liked Cryptonomicon and Anathem and loved Snow Crash, but I feel like Stephenson is almost antagonistic in how condescending he is to the reader sometimes."

My thoughts and feelings go much deeper than this on the subject, but she helped me figure out who I really was and helped me realize I was really a woman. When ever I have doubts, I think of where I've been, what I've felt, and it helps me know that, I'm me and when I have to deal with transphobic asshats, that, in the end, they don't matter to me.

Perhaps I'm wrong. Does anyone have any recommendations for me in terms of novels/series that deal with matters of race?"

Any particular direction you are taking?

2551,"This week has been interesting, to say the least. It all started on Monday, when I saw [a YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABgL2LcoBTU) posted on /r/getmotivated about some guy who approaches a beautiful girl in a store and simply asks ""Are you single?"" The girl's positive reaction served as an inspiration for me, and I decided to try it in real life. 

Tuesday I went to a clothes shop at the local mall to buy a jacket. As I walk in there with confidence and a smile upon my face, the girl in there says ""You look like you know what you want,"" with a smile on her face. ""Yes, I do,"" I said. I told her I wanted a jacket and she started showing me jackets. Taking a deep breath I then asked her casually ""Are you single?"" while looking at her with a smile.

She starts giggling, before she tells me (exact quote): ""I do have a boyfriend, but I wish I wasn't in a relationship."" She continued to look at me. - ""What about you? Do you have a girlfriend?""

""Y-no,"" I answered. For some reason I was about to say 'yes' to that question, but quickly changed it to 'no'. That got her intrigued.

""That was an interesting answer,"" she said. I said something about that I used to be in a long relationship, but not anymore (a lie; that relationship ended years ago). Then we spent some time trying jackets, keeping a friendly conversation. I bought a jacket at a bargain price, along with some socks, which I playfully dropped down on the counter next to her. That made her giggle. 

When I left the store, her male colleague gave me thumbs up while she looked the other way.

Today (Friday) I was on a supermarket at the same mall, shopping beer and groceries for the weekend. As I stand in line to the cashiers, I see this beautiful, young brunette with ice-blue eyes sitting behind my cashier. I load my groceries onto the conveyor belt and patiently wait for my turn. She greets me, I greet her. She scans my groceries. She tells me how much it is. 

""I'll use my card,"" I say and swipe my card. Then I ask her confidently (but casually): ""Are you single?"" I smile to her. 

""What?"" she asks, looking at me in something looking like disbelief. 

""Are you single?"" I repeat with the same confidence. 

""Yeah..."" she asks with a smile and a downward gaze, charmingly geeky, almost guffawing, even twisting a little bit in her chair. 

""You wanna go on a date with me?"" I ask her. She looks at me with that same guffawing demeanor. 

""I work so much, almost every day,"" she replies, her voice thickening a bit as if she's about to start giggling (or groaning). 

""We'll take each day as it comes,"" I answer cool and casual. - ""Have a nice day, A[...]."" Her name tag is fully visible on the left side of her chest. 

""You too,"" she says. I pack my groceries, bid her goodbye and leave the store with a big smile on my face. 

**At the very same day**, when I enter the gym, I see the blond, gorgeous woman behind the counter which I've fancied for some time. I say hello to her, she says hello back with her beautiful smile. I swipe my member's card, before turning to her with a serious look: 

""Listen, S[...], I need to ask you a question."" She is all ears. - ""Are you single?"" 

A big smile appear on her face. 

""I'm afraid I'm not."" I smile back at her. - ""Sorry, no. I'm not."" 

""I felt I had to simply ask you,"" I replied. She totally agreed, still with a big smile on her face. 

Then we switched over to a completely normal conversation with her being very helpful and I being completely cool and casual. I don't think the smile disappears from her face at all. She wishes me a good work-out, and I wish her a pleasant day, before I go and change. 

**Less than an hour later** I approach this young, stunning brunette with beautiful hazel eyes. I've noticed that she sent me some looks while I worked out. 

""Hi,"" I say with a smile. She turns to me, almost as if startled. 

""Oh, hi,"" she says. 

""Are you okay?"" I ask. 

""Yeah, I'm fine,"" she says. Her voice is tender, and she has a kind and quiet demeanor. 

""You were over at the treadmill, weren't you?"" I ask her. She says 'yes'. - ""Are you single?"" I feel my heart racing as I look into her eyes. She giggles: 

""No, I'm not."" 

""You kept looking at me from over there,"" I said with a smile. 

""Oh, I'm sorry!"" she exclaims in a most humble manner. She's actually blushing! 

""No, no, it's okay,"" I say with a soothing voice. - ""It's very nice that you have a boyfriend."" She smiles at me with her kind eyes. - ""Have a nice work-out."" 

""Thank you,"" she says, smiling. 

I leave her with a big grin on my face, walking like I don't have a care in the world. Four approaches in four days. Three approaches in one single afternoon. A skilled pick-up artist couldn't have done it better. Although I got three nos and one 'maybe', my chance would have been zero if I hadn't approached at all. 

**Tl;dr: Confronted my fears and approached four girls in four days, three of those in one afternoon. Got three nos and one 'maybe'.**"
2552,"Last weekend I had one drink.  Just one but I could just feel my sense of accomplishment fade away as the guilt creeps in.  I wasn't around people who support my decision not to drink and they honestly don't think I have a problem.  I was extremely disappointed in myself but I went home,  got some rest and the next day just started anew.  

I'm accepting that its ok to fail and realizing how hard it is to completely stop drinking in a world where NOT drinking is seen as some sort of social blunder.  

I just want to encourage anyone else out there that is struggling,  or who has slipped up.  Even if you slipped a little bit or a lot you can always start again.  Don't listen to that voice telling you that you can't do it.  It's a liar.  "

2554,"**EDIT:** Thanks for all the love and support everyone!  You've all helped me stay on track and be motivated to succeed - and I hope I've done the same for at least one person.  I decided to also tell my brother last night.  He came over, we had a beer, and I had him read the exact same email.  Now I have a team around me, and we're going to do a lot of things (internet filter, weekly checkins, more connections, volunteer work, possibly seeing a professional) to make sure I can overcome this.  We decided to let it soak in for the newcomers, and we're all going to sit down next week and make a plan.  I'm open to helping anybody on here via PM, so please let me know if I can help you.  And I'll try to reply to everyone, but thankfully I have a busy day on not touching my dick ahead of me!  Keep kicking ass everyone!

------------------

As you can see by my flair, I'm only on my second day.  After emailing with my mom earlier today, she said that she found of box of my old stuff and said: ""I am going to bring you the file as well because, my son, you were quite the stud in your young life.  So very many accolades.  Somewhere along the way, you seemed to quit believing in yourself.  I think it would be good for you to go through this file and see what you were and still are capable of.""

I replied that I already knew I was a failure, and then got into a bit of a pity party, telling her that I wished I could tell her the truth, but I just couldn't, and it would break her heart.  Of course, she's a mom, so she said I could tell her anything.  I decided to honey badger this shit and just lay it on her.  So I wrote a long email, and then texted her to get Dad and go read it in their bedroom (relatives live with them, don't want them involved).  In the hope that I can inspire other fapstronauts to get over their fear of involving loved ones in this transformation, I'm pasting the letter below (with redactions/changes for privacy)(also, my family isn't shy with the cussing, as you will see)**:**

-----------------------

What changed?  It wasn't really ""an event"", but a series of things.  You want to know, so I'll tell you, but I'd recommend that you are sitting down when you read this, because it's gonna hurt.

So I was much like most teenagers.  When it came to sex though, I was very naive and unprepared.  But since I was smart and good with computers, I found out a lot about sex from the internet.  I know you know that with how many times you caught me with porn.  Now, without grossing my out too much, I'm sure you've seen porn before.  Porn is not sex.  But it is a sex substitute.  I was quickly able to get a hold of a lot of porn.  Teenagers are horny, they masturbate a lot, and in these days, they watch porn.  So what?

Well, I lost my virginity at 16.  It was less exciting than I wanted it to be.  It felt good and all, but it wasn't porn.  It was quick, awkward, and then felt extremely weird afterward.  I'm sure you're familiar with the limited talks I had with you guys about sex - ""Wear a rubber"" was about the only advice Dad had for me.  Thankfully, I did follow that.

So I had sex a couple times, and then not for awhile.  In between, I watched plenty of porn.

The next time I tried to have sex (at 17 years old), I couldn't keep an erection.  Yes, ""this happens to all guys"", but holy shit was that a confidence killer.  The girl was really hot, I really liked her, there was no reason for things not to work.  But I wasn't really turned on.  It was sort of meh.  So that sucked, but I didn't give up.  I tried again - fail.  I tried again - fail.  I never tried again until college, because I thought college would solve my problems.  It didn't.

I met some girls at college.  Went on some dates.  Tried sex a couple of times - it didn't work.  So I retreated.  You know when I could keep an erection?   Watching porn.  So I went deep down the rabbit hole, and developed the horrible habits that I'm still trying to kick to this day.  Everyone masturbates from time to time, but I started masturbating 2, 3, 4 times/day.  Why do you think I dropped out of college?  You didn't honestly think it was just drugs and alcohol, did you?  I could skate through classes like it was nobodies business.  But I started staying home from class because my roommate was gone then, so I could watch porn.  It became what I did to pass time, when I was nervous, when I was tired, when I was anxious, when I was excited, when I had something to do, when I had nothing to do...

Remember that girl **** that I dated?  Why do you think we broke up?  Ugh, this is so awkward to be writing to my mom, but let me tell you something: there is no worse feeling than not being able to get an erection with a girl you are into.  She couldn't understand that it wasn't her.  And girls want to have sex - she was a cute girl, and wasn't going to wait around for a guy that couldn't get his dick to work properly.  That was pretty much the final shot for me.  I gave up.

Do you have any idea what life is like if you know (I know that's wrong, but its how I felt at the time) that you'll never pleasure a partner?  I wanted to get married and have kids, build a family, travel the world, have fun, and share it with a significan other.  Well, all of that was out the window.  I had no prospects for my future.  I tried to fill the void - I thought I could work myself through it, that didn't help.  I thought I could drug myself through it, that didn't help.  I thought setting big external goals like going to law school would help, it didn't.  By the time I graduated college, I was miserable.  I was working a shit job only because my mom had got it for me, I had a shit degree from a shit college that I wasn't going to do shit with.  None of my strategies had helped.  I couldn't care about a life where I wasn't ever going to be able to pleasure a woman.  I kept working at the law firm because fuck it, who cares?

At this point, I was still masturbating 2-6 times/day (I'm so sorry to gross you out).  Why did I quit the law firm?  Another strategy to try to get rid of this!  I thought that once I was in control of my life, I could kick the habit.  As I'm sure you can guess, that didn't happen.  Working from home only made it easier.  And with all the self doubt I had from this shit, I just kept feeding it.  Even when I was completely in control of my own life, I'd just waste the entire day in bed, hating myself, hating my life, hating what I had come to.  I made enough money to get by, but just barely.

Now, I'm at damn near rock bottom.  I have tens of thousands of dollars of credit card debt and nothing to show for it.  I haven't paid my student loans in a year - they are going to collections.  I own nothing, I have no plans for the future.  What's the point?  I can't ever have what I want.  I don't think you can possibly understand how bleak life is when you know you can never have what you want.

Somehow though, I haven't given up yet.  My back is against the wall.  I'm going to miss my credit card payments in a week, and then I really don't know what I'm going to do.  And it's not because I can't make money - I have people begging me to do work for them.  But whats the point of getting out of bed if you know that your whole day is just going to be spent hating yourself?  Some days I just wouldn't get out of bed at all, literally.  I'd cycle through porn and masturbation, smoking weed and browsing the internet, and crying myself back to sleep.  EVERYTHING in my life is because of this.

It's why I don't do anything with my life.  It's why I don't do stand up comedy, even though I'd be amazing at it.  It's why I never owned my own restaurant, even though it was a dream of mine and I'd kill it.  It's why I didn't go to law school.  WHAT IS THE POINT OF ANY OF THAT IF YOU WILL NEVER HAVE WHAT YOU WANT IN LIFE?  Why should I get up on stage and make girls laugh if I can't take any of them home with me?  Or worse - take them home and ruin the night because I can't get it up.  There are only so many times that a guy can see the ""What do you mean you can't get it up?"" face.  And unfortunately, I'm just not evil enough to only want money in life.  What's the point of having money if you can't spend it on taking a beautiful girl out to dinner because you know you can't take her home later?  You know why I quit playing soccer?  That abdominal pain I have? Its from ruining my pelvic muscles with constant masturbation.  I'm ruining myself, body and mind.

But, like I said, I haven't given up.  In fact, in the last year, I've discovered that I'm not alone, not at all - thousands of young men from all walks of life are currently in the same prison.  I really didn't think anyone else could possibly live this life and not kill themselves.  It's so horrible.  It's not a regular addiction like cigarettes or booze or drugs.  It's not something I can announce on facebook: ""Two days without porn everyone! Yay me!""  It's a prison that no one can see.  And, worst of all, it is completely free.  I don't have to rob or steal to get my fix, I just have to keep paying my comcast bill.  Speaking of that, some of my money problems do stem from porn - I was sued for illegally downloading movies.  I went to a lawyer, and he recommended that I just settle, even though I could probably beat it, but it would be long and public.  So I settled for $3500 that I didn't have.  Ugh.

But like I said, I haven't given up.  I'm trying to kick this horrible situation.  I don't know right now if you understand how grave this situation is for me, or if you think it's all a joke.  So here are a couple of links that might help:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSF82AwSDiU - The Great Porn Experiment - a TED talk by the leading researcher on this stuff.

www.yourbrainonporn.com - Information, resources, and support for people in my situation.

www.reddit.com/r/nofap - Where I'm going for support to try to get out of this.  It's semi-anonymous which helps me be open.

Most people that have successfully beat this problem go through the following phases: The tough initial stage (1-7 days), a clarity phase (8-30 days, give or take), a flat-line where you have 0 libido (at any time, usually only lasts a couple of weeks), and then it gets better, the libido comes charging back, the ED is gone, and sex is pleasurable again.  They advocate a no-PMO lifestyle (no Porn, Masturbation, or Orgasm).  This is only until you have rewired your brain to enjoy natural sex and respond to it appropriately.  Masturbation is not the demon, its the way we masturbate to modern pornography that makes the difference (pay attention to the part of the youtube clip where he shows that older people recover faster than younger people, because their problems didn't develop UNTIL they got high speed internet whereas the younger generation has always had it).

I've tried to quit this horrible, degrading, demotivating lifestyle multiple times.  I don't know if you've ever noticed, but whenever we go on family vacation, I'm usually pretty miserable on days 2-4.  Those are the days that I'm adjusting to not getting my fix.  I usually want to kill somebody when I wake up, but as the day goes along, and if we stay busy enough, I get through it.  But as soon as I get back home, it's right back to where I left off.

I've thought about asking my brothers for help, but I don't think they would understand.  I've sort of told ****** about some of it (gee - why do you think ****** and I have never got together?).  Hell, there was a point when I thought maybe I was just gay and I wasn't getting it, as I know others have speculated.  Well, I tried it out once, it didn't do it for me.  I told dad once that I was having erection problems, and he told me to go to the doctor.  I did, and he told me its nothing physical (I knew that, because I could easily get an erection with porn).  I even went to a psychologist for a bit, but that shit is mega expensive, and it seemed like I knew as much as he did (why do you think I took psychology classes in college?).

So there it is Ma.  That is what happened to me.  I don't think you can possibly comprehend the look on a girls face when she's begging you to fuck her and all you can say is ""I can't right now.""  I don't think you have any idea what it feels like to expect your life to be unfulfilling forever.  It's extremely hard to pursue your goals if you know you'll never be able to share them with anybody.  And please don't tell me that if I found the right girl, it wouldn't matter.  It DOES matter.  It's huge.  Women deserve a man that can love them, and they know that.  I wouldn't want any woman to be in a relationship with a guy that couldn't please her.  I've tried all sorts of relationships - with good girls, with bad girls, with girls I love, with girls I don't care about, even some morally unpopular choices - I was doing anything I could try to get a response.  But none of it mattered, and I'd just come home to watch more porn.

I know I've been a disappointment.  I don't want to be.  I want to change.  I'm trying, very hard.  And well, now that you know what the fuck my problem has been, now I'm asking for help.  Nothing specific, I don't even know how you possibly could help, but there will likely be a time in the next couple of months (if I stick with it), where I'm going to need help.

I can't wait to get past this.  I know I'm more than the person I have become.  I'm sooooo much more.  But I can't be that while I'm trapped in this self-imposed prison.  You're right - I want to fly.  But I'm a bird in a cage.  I'm trying to pry the fucking door open with one hand, while my other hand holds it closed.  If I can ever get out of here, watch out world.

You don't need to write back.  We can talk about this when we have lunch.  I don't know how I'm going to be able to look you in the eye at dinner Friday night.  But you wanted to know, and I know I need to tell you, so there it is.  I want to assure you that drugs and alcohol haven't ever been my problem.  Sure, like to drink and smoke pot, but so does everyone.  I don't even do either of those very much anymore.  My problem has always been the PMO addiction cycle.  Please watch the video so you can understand how hard this cycle is to break.

Yesterday, I committed myself to trying again.  I have to keep trying.  I'm the only person that put myself in this situation, so I'm the person that is going to get me out of it.  I can, and I will, I just have to stick with it.

Love you."

Pick a number 1-500 and random.org will decide the winner. I like when these posts have some actual content, though. Not just people posting games and numbers. While you're at it, why not post something funny or uplifting with the game and number? This is by no means a requirement. Winner will be selected tomorrow at 10PM EST.

Edit: Would like to clarify that by ""not feeling well"" I mean I've been feeling sick, not that I want to jump off a bridge. I appreciate the kind words and encouragement all the same. Thanks!

I know I said 10PM EST but I actually have to be somewhere soon I was not expecting. Random.org has chosen and /u/yoloswagrofl is the winner. Congratulations and thanks to everybody for entering. I'll be back to do another for sure."

2565,"People I know from the classical school always talk about their yoga or tai chi or whatever, and they mostly thought it was a waste of time; sure musical ideas can only be expressed as well as our bodies will allow- that's the very essence of practice. But is a martial art like Yoga or pilates really necessary to get the most from our practice time, or is it pretty much just something recommended?

I see the logic to it, but my rationale is there are better things to spend your time on. And everyone from both schools seemed to take a ""aint nobody got time for that"" approach; so the wisdom of people who see and experience the benefit of practising a passive martial art would be greatly appreciated."

I found r/keto browsing /r/all. Being able to see the progress pic with ease piqued my interest and brought me in. *I would likely not be here otherwise*.

We vote to bring the things we want to the top. I'm sorry you mods don't like what we like, but deal with it. *We* make this a community, not you.

I'm starting a new subreddit, /r/freeketo. There will never be any moderation or restrictions there, ever. Feel free to join.

I am unsubbing from /r/keto. If you object to this decision, you should too.

EDIT: another option is /r/theketodiet, who have done a nice job getting their ball rolling and have promised to keep their moderation very hands off.

EDIT2: I'd like to bring some attention to a portion of andr50's comment. While I don't agree with all of it (I am recommending leaving), he does have a very good idea:

> If the mods are not happy about the science articles not hitting the top, they should do something similar to what /r/gaming did - keep /r/keto the catch-all, keep it the big, front-page keto sub, and spec the science to /r/ketoscience or something. Make ANOTHER place for jsut the stuff they want propagated, and keep the 50k+ subscribers who subscribed already because of what the community IS (not what they want / think it could it to be)

Mostly I try to explain it and they immediately compare it to some other FPSs like Dead Island or Left 4 Dead or even ""Battlefield 3 without tanks and stuff"".

2575,"Good morning/evening. Whichever's appropriate. 

For the TL:DR: I'm looking for a French DUB of MLP:FIM as well as French T.V. shows akin to America's sesame street. 

The Long Story: After becoming hugely inspired by MLP, the fandom, and everything I've decided to start my own ""Cutie Mark Crusade!"" It's pretty simple to understand. Every month I choose something and dedicated myself to learning/exploring that one skill. If the skill is appealing then it becomes a hobby that might eventually grow into a passion. If not, well, I'll know that thing is not my cup of tea. THE KEY!!! is to keep trying that skill for the entirety of the month. You don't have to go crazy, but when you have free time read a book about it or poke at small beginners projects. 

I started in December with exercise, it was hard with the winter and taught me I'll have to find activities instead of regiment. January was cooking month, which was SO YUMMY! It's easier than it sounds and is great for meeting new people. I still make dinner once a week for my family, it's a blast! 

Onto February. My friend heard I was doing this so we decided to work together (friendship is magic, after-all). Through family we got our hands on pimsleur french CDs and have been busting them out ever since. The first few are hard because your brain goes reeling from trying to learn from scratch. But after less than two weeks, we're making dinner plans in French. I'd like to find MLP:FIM and other amusing shows to watch while keeping toward simpler phases so I can piece things together. [Why French?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qb9uFehsZ0) If any PLounger could point me in a direction, that'd be awesome! 

Hope this might inspire others to take up their own Cutie Mark Crusade. You never know until you try!

I offer the equivalent of 'bonus xp' in my game if people go above and beyond to role play and really get into their character, but it just doesn't seem to be doing the job. We recently had a new player join us that is a very experienced role player. I gave the player the 'bonus xp' at the end of the game and made sure to remind the other players that is one way to gain things in the game, but it just is not clicking. Normally I would just play on, but it seems we may lose this new player because role playing against a brick wall is tough for the player. I've also offered 'bonus xp' for background stories, diaries kept by the character in first person, but none of it seems to work. Reddit... any ideas or ways you encourage your players to get into character? I also understand not everyone role plays in table top games, but it would be a real shame to lose this new player :-/

I am finishing another great day at my new job and starting my drive home. I am tired as hell, havent been sleeping right at all and very hungry. Add to that Boston is in a state of emergency with the flu, and I felt like shit. 

Anyhow, I take a couple rips of some chronic and start driving. All of the sudden it starts getting really cold in my car so I start to think of things that warm me...like say some good #4. Soon to discover my heater is jammed from me spilling coffee on it earlier. It got very cold. Okay, thoughts are back to some #4. But I am almost 2 months clean from opiates. How do I get it? My thought process then turns to bitcoins and moneygrams.

I hear the song, Semi-charmed Kind of Life, by 3EB. It was playing through pandora on my phone. The lyrics, ""I want something else"" kept repeating, and it triggered something in my brain. I wanted something else other than dope and drugs to make me happy. I then decided to not buy a lot of bitcoins and use drugs, for now at-least.

Thanks for listening, and I guess let the Reddit judgement commence?

It feels very exposing and what not. 

Anyway, here we go again, and this time I DO have the photos! Just facials but you'll see on the before picture how very uncomfortable I was being in front of a camera back then. It wasn't my fav thing to do you can say... 
Here they are http://imgur.com/a/MkatP#0
Tiny little album and there will be more to come. 

So, what basicly has happened is that I went from about 150something to 100kg exact (from 330lb to 220lb for you weird people with your non-metric system). 
How it happened is somewhat of a mystery, since I was in the middle of the weightloss before I even gave it a thought. 
To begin with, I have MS. Something that has made it hard as fucking hell at times to actually lose weight. The disease in itself doesn't promote either loss or gain, but the effects of it doesn't help when they kick in. Now the relapses don't come that often, but when they arrive, I've wanted to give up. I'm the first one to admit that. 
I think that if I had made a real resolve to start losing weight when I was at my heaviest, I wouldn't have made it. I'm not very good at keeping resolves in general, but this time I didn't give it a second thought until I realised that my clothes where getting too large for me. That was a shock, and I wanted to eat more to be able to fit in them again. But then I took a step back, and a step up on the scale, and decided that I had two choices. Either one: keep feeling bad for the ambulance personel that had to lift me when I hit a major low, or two: keep losing weight and not feeling guilty when they had to help me into the ambulance on a stretcher. 
A bit weird, I know, but the ambulance people where the only ones that made me feel guilty about my weight. Not because they scolded me, just because I felt bad about they having to strain their backs in the stairs. 

How I lost it is easy tho. I've never trusted diets. At all. I've tried a few before, and most of all, I've always seen them more as a gimmick then anything else, something for people to make money out of. 
But I've also worked in restaurants for a lot of my life, so I had a general grasp on what is good for you and not, and the rest of the knowledge I needed I just went to the library and read up on. 
In general, I started to eat less, eat more frequent and work out more. In the begining by swiming and walking with the dogs, getting myself a GOOD pedometer that kept track of distance, time walked and calories burnt, not to mention storing it so I could keep track of the weekly walks. I set my limit to 10 000 steps a day, and it took about two weeks before I reached it, but now I reach it every day and can hit 35 000 steps on good days. Usually I end up at 16-17k steps aday, but it varies a bit. 
It was hard at first, walking with a cane for those distances, since my right side, after being paralysed completely in the past, didn't want to cooperate with me, but it sorted itself out and now I don't need the cane when walking, at all. Sure, I can have days when I probably SHOULD have the cane, but now it's a bit of a pride thingie to not use it. It's waiting for me in the closet tho for the days when there's no choice. 

End rant! I had no clue on what to write and now time caught up with me and I need to go to work. 
Phew.. Take care now folks!"

I would offer C.S. Lewis [Space Trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Space_Trilogy), and Harry Harrison's [To The Stars Trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_the_Stars_(trilogy) as examples.

I read Lewis' trilogy so long ago I am not going to try to explain what was different, just that it was so different that it made me realize an author could write a trilogy where the settings, characters, antagonists, etc were so different that they almost seemed different books. I'd never had that thought before.

I am reading *To The Stars* right now, and it gave me the same feeling I had before.

What are some other books that does this?  Please recommend.

2636,"Hey Grumplings, I seem to recall a little while back Jon and Arin talking about how they think people who want to do something need to just... you know, DO it. (I believe it was during an episode of Banjo Kazooie, though I'm not 100% sure)

I was just wondering if there's anything out there that you guys have decided to just go ahead and do because of that talk.

Myself, I started doing short game review videos (not of the highest quality) on YouTube.

2637,"I honestly can't believe I made it here. A few months ago it seems like an impossible goal- 30 days seemed impossible- but I'm here and I'm sober and it feels amazing. 

I remember when I was first lurking in the sub I use to click through posts of people who had some time to see what has changed for them as a result of getting sober, ya know, to see if it was really all it was cracked up to be. Holy hell, it is. 

First of all, I look a million times better. My skin is clear, my eyes are bright and sparkling, my face isn't puffy and bloated. Although I didn't lose the drastic amount of weight some people describe, I sort of replaced booze with food for awhile (which honestly I think is the best way to handle it at first - have whatever your heart desires as long as isn't booze) but since the new year I've just made some small, healthy, changes to my diet and I've easily dropped 6 lbs and counting :) 

Emotionally, I'm a different person. I'm not a sad, shaking, anxiety ridden mess anymore. I can go out to dinner with friends, I can pick someone up for a meeting I dont know that well, I can smoke a cigarette in front of someone without worrying about my hands shaking, I can hold a coffee cup, I can eat soup. I can go to class and participate, I can hand the person next to me the attendance sheet. 90 days ago, I couldnt do any of those things without a drink. 

That all being said, it certainly hasnt been a cake walk either. Early sobriety is an emotional rollar coster. You have to actually feel the feelings you've been drowning for so long, and it sucks, but its worth it. My sponsors says, ""The only way to get through it, is to go through it.""

I really truely, honestly want to thank this sub though. I know for a fact I would not be in this place today if I had not stumbled into IRC  and everyone had stopped what they were talking about to listen to me, and ever so gently explain to me that I may need to quit drinking. That they had been where I am and it worked for them. That it wouldn't be easy but I could do it, and more importantly, I was worth doing it. I may have found my way eventually, but it would have taken me many many more years of misery. I am forever grateful for the people in this sub, I don't know what I would do without you guys (wow this is getting mushy, but for real, I mean it.) 

Anyway, thanks for reading. Thanks for being here. Thankyouthankyouthankyou. "

2642,"As opposed to introverted feeling? What are the differences?
Having trouble figuring out if I really am an INTP or not and this is a cognitive function that I'm really unsure of.

I had a personality test done when I was 18 (three years ago) and I never bothered to look into it til recently. Now I'm unsure of the result (which was INTP) and I'm trying to look into the MBTI functions as opposed to taking online tests to determine if I really am an INTP.

(Online tests that I have taken previously, always show that I am 50% T and 50% F which is pretty confusing)."

2658,"If this sounds ridiculous, I concede it is probably due to my ignorance of genetics and CRISPR's capabilities in that domain.  Sorry about that, but please educate me!  But the reason I ask is because a) we allow animal testing that we wouldn't allow for humans, and b) while the application of sapience to produce abstract knowledge-based intelligence over generations may be largely environmental, sapience itself is largely genetic, right?  And once the genetic/structural aspects are accounted for, shouldn't humans be able to train animals *how* to think abstractly?

Sapience may be genetically complex, but so are holistic aims like reversing the aging process.  At least sapience is confined to a single organ, and we have a good starting point in contrasting the genetics of humans from those of other primates.

Anyhow, I know that's a sloppy argument; I'm really just asking the question.  Is it reasonable to expect CRISPR to dramatically change opportunities for currently non-sapient animals both prior to and more dramatically than the changes to human opportunities?

Edit: Thanks for the great answers!"

2666,"I just discovered a desert world filled with pre-sapient desert chicken, so I thought maybe my empire can have desert chicken tendies. but then I noticed that Pre-Sapient policies only include a hunting option which will slowly deplete their population until my desert chicken eventually go extinct.

Of course, there is a sustainable way of processing them into food by turning them into livestock-type slaves, but since pre-sapients can't be turned into slaves (or any other kind of citizenship for that matter), I can't turn them into livestock without first uplifting them into sentience, which even turns the issue into an ethical atrocity which xenophiles are going to hate me for. 

To sum it up, I believe it should be possible for the player to turn Pre-Sapients into sustainable livestock, like they can do to intelligent pops, so I can have my desert chicken tendies!!"

The tech company I work for was acquired and now we have new business capabilities. Our new message is ""Powerful Convergence: The Intersection of Business and IT Infrastructure"". We're using images of antelope canyon on the website. 

I understand a convergent boundary is the point where two plates collide, and then erosion smooths out the areas that were once rugged and rocky.

2685,"After seeing all the weight loss pictures, I though I would share mine as well! Although I ate mostly healthy food, my weight was just keep on climbing every year after 5th grade. At the end of my freshmen year of high school, I was over 200 pounds with a lot of health and skin issues. I was pretty much at rock bottom at the time with all the looks and teases I got from school and extended family. I mean how often do you see an obese Asian. :P I tried diet herbal medication during my sophmore year, which help me lose 30 pounds. However, my body became tolerant of the herbs and I stayed around 160-170lbs. During junior year of high school, I regained back 20 pounds after a family member passed away with a period of emotional eating. I don't have any pictures from the height of my weight and I would rather not see one. The picture was taken in Junior year for graduation when I weight aroud 170 pounds (I lost the 20 pounds I gained after breaking up with my ex). 

After years of struggling with various diets and some desperate (not so smart) ways to lose weight during college, I notice the toll it taken on my body. After all the yo-yo weight gain and lost, I lost 2/3 of my hair and my skin was extremely saggy. It wasnt until the recent past 2 years, I finally found the healthy way to lose weight and keep the weight off. I do not limit myself to just steamed veggies and salads (without dressing and toppings). I eat everything, but watch the portion size and calories count to make sure I eat a balance diet. The change really helped my cravings and made me much happier in life. I researched and tried out different skincare products and turned my horrible skin condition around. Now people are amazed and constantly complimenting my skin. I finally found peace with myself and my weight after struggling with my weight for more than 10 years now. I learned that you're doing this for yourself and not for others. It doesn't really matter what other people do or say, the real motivation and determination comes from within. However, I do love how the people jaws drop after seeing the new me. ;) I have 10 more pounds to lose and hopefully it will be by the end of 2013. :)

I am generally interested in this market and wish to somehow get involved with it in the future (I am a Computer Science student hoping to become a game designer some day).

So, redditors.. Tell me your ideas. 
Why do you think they would succeed?  
Why do you think companies haven't made such ideas a reality yet? "

2694,"I'm half crunchy. I'm pregnant with a boy, 27 weeks this Thursday, and I have a 19 month old son. I'm still breastfeeding, we co-sleep. I work from home, and we do I guess semi attachment parenting? He's never been one for a wrap, but I don't do CIO or any other sleep training, if he cries, he's hugged. I also had pain management during my last labor, and I'm planning on pain management for this labor. I vaccinate, and I have an OB GYN with no doula. I feel like I'm too ""crunchy"" for moms who are more I guess streamline, but I'm not au naturale enough for those green moms. Where do I belong?!?"

I actually reached my goal right before Thanksgiving, but then promptly added some nice holiday weight on.  Nothing bad, just needed to spend a month getting back into shape.  I promised I would update when I accomplished this so here you go!  I decided to follow a dream of mine to become a professional sports team dancer this weekend!  Although I didn't quote make it, I did a damn good job of keeping up with girls 10 years younger than me who hadn't stopped dancing for nearly a decade!  I plan to keep auditioning and keep dancing, and I that would not have ever been an option for me if I hadn't changed my lifestyle, thanks to plenty of your inspiring stories!!

Thank you /r/loseit!!!

Edit:  I forgot to add my starting weight around 140, although I'm fairly certain it was closer to 150 at my heaviest.  Current weight, 110, although it fluctuates between 108-113.  I'm 5'1"". :)"

2701,What are some of the trends you have been noticing in the comic book industry? Are you worried about where things may be headed?
2702,"Ephesians 5:22-33 ESV

> Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands.

> Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish. In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church, because we are members of his body. “Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.” This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church. However, let each one of you love his wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband.

Colossians 3:18-19 ESV
> Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives, and do not be harsh with them.

The way I see it there are 3 different approaches to take with these passages:

1. Paul said wives must submit to their husbands, therefore the male will always be the head and the final authority, no matter what.

2. Paul was a misogynistic dick who didn't see that it doesn't matter what sex a person is, both people in a marriage have equal say and make their decisions mutually.

3. Paul said that and it has value, but it doesn't mean what everyone usually think it means. (I honestly don't know what else it could mean.)

I struggle with these passages and I would like further insight from egalitarians or people who have further insight into the passages.

EDIT: So #4 would be that Paul was a product of his culture and when he wrote about male headship he was not solidifying a subservience within marriage, but he was simply ""going with the flow"" in terms of cultural norms, while relating those norms as a figure of servanthood within the Christian leadership structure.

That's a long run-on sentence, but you get my drift.

2703,"Guys, as if we needed more reasons to love this brand - turns out it's run by an incredibly sweet woman who has been really promptly helping me with some issues the last couple days! Yesterday I was just following up on my order, and she kindly reassured me that it was still in the system and apologized for any delays due to the big sale. But today... today she was especially lovely, even though things got way screwed up on my end. 

Long story short, I spent a ton of time on the phone with PayPal today trying to open a dispute for a box (from a different company!) that never showed up. For whatever reason - crossed wires, the full moon, I don't know - the claim got filed for a-england. O_O I found this out just a few minutes after getting off the phone with PayPal, when I got a concerned but still incredibly nice message from Adina at a-england confirming the package went out yesterday and asking what was up (and apologizing yet again!) I wrote back immediately telling her that it was a huge mistake, and she was just so sweet and understanding. I was so embarrassed, I must have given the poor women a heart attack! 

So, here I am, writing this post partly because I want to make it up to Adina for spooking her, and partly to tell you that you now have at least one more reason to spend your next paycheck on this lovely small business. Expect more raves and photos when I finally get to try on Dragon!  "
2704,"Ever wondered why Visitors' Center Sister Missionaries are often younger, prettier and thinner than their counterparts in the field? This might help clear that up:

and

2706,"I'm nearly done with Pandora's star, and to be honest, I found it a labour to read. I found Hamilton's writing style read like a teenage soap-opera novel and focused on a lot of trivial details (e.g. the model numbers for train engines). I don't say this to act like some kind of authority on sci-fi writing, but to give you an idea of my preferences. 

So what I'm looking for from you fine people is a good read that involves interaction with alien races (and not just in the *they're trying to kill us* way). Perhaps they're our allies (in some kind of UN), our stewards - overseeing our development, our trade partners... just some kind of *interesting* narrative that involves alien races interacting with humanity. 

Something where humanity is part of a bigger universe of life and culture, not by Peter Hamilton. 

Many thanks. "

A bit of background: I've written a fair amount of fanfic and original fic, and have been a general Holmes fan (original stories & Granada show) for many years.

2723,"I don't care if this should be in seddit or whatever it's called. NoFap is my commune -- you are my brothers and sisters. Let me tell you of what made my day today.

Second longest attempt at NoFap, just started on my sixth week. Longest having been 60 something days. Positive this streak will crush that one. 25, M.

I usually get my groceries at this one place, and there's this girl there who is really pretty. I've been telling myself I should ask what her name is, but I've bailed many times. The usual excuse like ""oh, this is not the right time"", ""she's busy and I shouldn't interrupt"" etc.

I go up to the register, we greet with smiles and I start loading my groceries on the threadmill-thingy. I pay and start putting my stuff into the bag. Next to me is standing this older lady and I'm having this inner struggle over the whole thing, what I should do and should I do anything at all. ""Wait, we're not alone, what about this lady?"" ""What's the girl doing, should I just excuse myself and leave?"" and all kinds of bullshit that puts sticks in my wheels. I tell myself I have to make this count, before I pack all my groceries or she walks away from the register. Luckily she starts stacking tobacco into their dispenser so as far as concering her I'm in the green. Now I just need to pep myself into opening my goddamn mouth for once.

I finish packing, I don't care about the old lady, just let her watch us. I look up and say, ""Excuse me"". She looks at me and I say ""I've been wondering for a while what your name is, could you tell me your name?"". ""Yes, I can tell you my name, it's T"". You know how in movies they tell you to smile? Well I'd be damned if I didn't smile like a champ the entire time, it just came so naturally. I continued ""hello T, my name is C"". I told her how I've been coming there for a good while and it's far more nicer knowing what the personnel's names are. She agreed and pointed with her finger towards her chest ""..and since we don't have name tags.."". Anyway, I'm sure she'll eventually find out I haven't asked the names of any of the other employees. But hey, that's besides the point. I repeat her name again, still smiling, she's smiling too. ""It is nice getting to know you"", she replies ""Likewise"". I wish her a good day, so does she and I walk out feeling like a baws. Outside I'm almost shouting in joy and placed on my face is this big smile. It felt really empowering and releasing.

After doing this I realised how utterly nonsensical and baseless fear and anxiety are when it comes to talking to strangers. I did this entirely for myself and no matter what will come from our next meetings I don't care if I get rejected. I talked to her, sober, in broad daylight. I was friendly, smiled and looked her straight in the eyes. I walked out back straight and I planted that seed of possibility. Who knows what will come, maybe we'll just chat once in a while when I shop, maybe we'll become friends or maybe lovers. Time will tell. Right now I'm just glad I did what I needed to do for myself; be more social."

Lifestyle change begins 01/2012


http://imgur.com/a/q9eWO


I think there are few words that feel as ugly and awkward as the word obese. Its the kind of word that always follows a sympathetic pause in the presence of the paunchy. It is so round and clinical and weighted down with taciturn lowness that it clings to a person in a way that squeezes and cripples him with what is simultaneously the most formidable and and the most elementary malady for a person to beat. January 5, marked one year since I resolved to change myself.This essay will probably be the most gushing and candid thing I’ve ever written, parts of this may seem attention seeking or boastful but I promise that this comes from the deepest, most sincere, and thought-worn parts of my heart. Its something I’ve had kicking around in my head for the better part of 15 years; this is the eulogy for my obesity.


Size has always dominated me, I began to chub around the fourth grade. I wouldn’t say that I was by any means a too-sad kid but I do think that feeling sad was a trigger for me. As a kid I had a difficult time finding a place where I felt like I was supposed to be. Whenever I would venture a try at something new, I would inevitably leave inadequate. I would feel bitter about being rejected by girls or I would feel sad about not being able to keep up with boys. In response I withdrew and went to food. As I grew up, I never felt right and I never I had anything that was mine with which to excel…I would fantasize about accomplishment and taking ownership of the kind of charisma and strength that would enamour me to those girls and make myself a hero in the minds of those guys, but I had lost so much ground over time that the idea of changing anything was daunting. It felt like my life was looming over me and I used food and humor as a means to swat it.


Gaining weight was mostly gradual with a few sharp spikes. It went on slowly until one day I realized that I was a fat kid and at once the idea got stuck in my head. I remember this feeling of compliance like:""well, this is me now."" As I grew older and boundaries widened, I became heavier. I would ride my bike to the Meijer on Clyde Park when it had a McDonalds in it and I would eat a Double Quarter meal Super-Sized and a twenty-piece chicken nuggets, turn around and ride home. This secret meal would lay on top of everything else I eaten during the day and I would enjoy it with stealth in my mind. It didn’t help that I was also slow to develop socially; I didn't have friends yet and food became music for me. It entertained and occupied me. I would go to movies by myself (which I loved doing) I would devour my lonely popcorn and inhale my propitious Pepsi. With every little bit of freedom I enjoyed, my weight gain would apex and level off. When I got my first job (at a pizza joint) I had tons of free food and money to spend on whatever I liked, when I got my license I could travel farther for different brands and combinations of fast food. Every bit of independance further cemented my habits.


Eventually I did develop a bit of a social lean but I still had a hard time accepting myself to my peers, I always felt like my stature stood between us. For example, one year we went to Michigan Adventure, I hadn’t thought much about the seat in a roller coaster and and never had a problem with a lap bar, but then I got in line for The Corkscrew. We waited eagerly and when the time came I walked up to the cart and looked inside and I thought ""shit."" I sat down next to a friend and it was tight but we were both able to sit. I reach up to pull down the shoulder harness and it wouldn’t click. My chest is too far from my back to get the harness to lock. I want to get out but instead an employee comes to me and tries to help by pressing it into me while I 'suck it in' No dice. I stood up and walked away with all the eyes on my back. I held the ride up and I was that fat kid that didn’t fit so I watched my friends ride the coaster from the sidewalk. It was the first time my size made me feel t isolated in front of someone. My attitude was to quietly tack roller coasters on to a list of things I couldn’t do. Eventually I out grew movie theater seats, airplane seats, and ‘Big & Tall’ sections in the mall and I passively waved goodbye to all of them.


And time just passed by - I built powerful, lasting, and comfortable relationships. I worked and had fun but never really achieved anything. I had quiet goals but all of the things I wanted for myself came to be plain conversational fodder, things you get drunk and dream about out loud. Everything I wanted was so public and everything I was was so private. I wanted to act and I wanted to be a comedian. I did open mics and it left me disgusted and exposed, it was a sort of exhilarating misery that kept you facing the goals you pushed away. I gradually lost momentum and just sort of stalled. Life for a few years was like a room dimly lit by the flickering light of a TV. It was quiet, and private, and comfortable. I remained stealthily obsessed with food. It occupied my mind. The flavors and textures and that feeling of occupation in your core gave me a sense of contentment that was so durable that it became ever-present in my life.


I haven’t always lacked a sense of the need for change. Periodically, I would have manic bouts of conviction and backbone. I would face the world and strive to be social, and better, and healthy. I would purse comedy again, I joined gyms, I sought and gained relationships...complacency though eventually had me back in my room eroding from a habit bordering agoraphobia. Eventually I realized that I wasn’t the possessor friends I once was and I became aware of the cheerlessness I felt for myself and that revealed to me the delicacy of the relationships I had. I was pushing people away from me so that I could revel in my faults. I began to see the folly and futility of so many of the years behind me. I became morbidly mindful of my mortality; I would imagine a roommate finding me dead and how they would react. How my family would react. In that, I realized that I’d lived so absent mindedly for so long that I had become OK with being dead when I was 40 and had subconsciously planned to be alone and idle for whatever time I had left. I’d let indulgence and apathy become intuitive.


A dramatic shift in my mindset came to pass around summer 2011. It was also around this time that I, as none of my friends or family knew, auditioned for a weight loss reality show. On the show, overweight men and women are taken away to a fitness sanctuary where they are taught healthy habits and exercise and exercise and exercise ... it was much like a real-life adult version of the movie Heavyweights. While gone, participants don’t communicate with family or friends and then, after an agonizing and heart lifting episode is complete, they are revealed to friends and family in a new body and attitude. I wanted to be a part of that show and thought I had it. I was interviewed and inline to be a part of the show when, abruptly, the series was put on hold and the new season never materialized.

I was devastated. I had poured my future into this idea that I could be taken away and fixed. That I was going to leave and come back as a new person for everyone to hold up cheer for. I had built up tremendous optimism and lost it all just as quickly. I went right back onto the destructive beat I had just left. Looking back, not making it on that show broke something for me and pushed me to get bad enough that I could get better.


Fortunately it only took about six months, I grieved the loss of my spotlight and my champion transformative moment and during that time reflected soulfully about who I am to the people in my life, who I am to myself, and most importantly recognized that I have it in myself to become the kind of person I want to be: I want to constantly be aware of my potential. I want to be a man that knows and practices right from wrong. I want to modestly inspire goodness, optimism, and effort in people; I want my integrity and my character to be something worth holding up. I want to be external and in the lives of people and I want people to feel that having me in their lives is a thing of value. In order to realize these things I had to accept accountability for what had misrepresented my capability and demeaned my resolve for so long. It wasn’t my weight, it was my attitude about life and an enduring lack of enthusiasm for the future.


I took responsibility for my well being one year ago, I weighed 420 pounds, I wore a XXXXXL dress shirt and 48 jeans. My life and the way I lived it literally changed overnight and hasn’t stumbled. I began by eating a calorie restricted diet and eventually shifted to focus on lower carbohydrates. For exercise I started by walking three miles a day. I would take the bus to school, get off walk a ways and get back on further down the route. Once spring rolled around I began to bike. Those rides progressed from two, to six, to ten mile rides, mostly to and from school. Soon the distance between school and home wasn’t clear or long enough so riding became a purposeful thing rather than utility. I rode and rode. By the end of the summer I had joined the half century club having ridden over fifty miles in one ride. In August I began running using the Couch to 5k program and ran my first full 5k on November 17 and putted along to finish my first 10k on December 15. As of today I have lost 178 pounds, wear a large and 34 jeans. I am stronger and faster than I’ve ever felt myself be. I feel appreciation and optimism in everything that I do and I sense that this is the way life should feel. I’ve still got a lot of work to do but at this point the habits have rooted and the education that I’ve gained over the last year will nurture them. I cannot see my life going backwards, this is who I was always supposed to be.


I’ve spent most of my life planning and daydreaming without action and now everything seems so attainable.This is why I write today, I’m ready to say goodbye to that old life now and to focus on maintaining goal oriented momentum and pushing harder so that the strength in my musings becomes the strength in my character. I can do better, I can do better. I can be the Greatest Man in the World.


Thank you to Mom, my Dad, Jerry, My brothers Eric and Adam, Jessica, Marshall, Corey, Colby; you guys specifically have given me clarity and always been frank with be about delicate things. And to Britt, Allen, Jen, Margie, and Alex, you guys give me the happiness I need to suck it up and do it. This might all seem overly sentimental but I only plan on doing this once and you’ve changed my life in ways that can’t really make sense to you.


Part of the audition process for the reality show I mentioned was to create a series of videos focusing on different aspects of my life. I edited one of them and am keeping a few private, but as for the rest, I don’t see a reason to keep it closeted anymore, I feel like that person is gone now. I uploaded these in May 2011, until now it has been accessible only to the producers of the show. For those interested, I have the links listed below. I think they are a thought-provoking relic.

2727,"The first one that springs to mind is Pumped Up Kicks by Foster the People. That up-beat, poppy track that you couldn't go a day without hearing for a few months is actually about a school shooting. "
2728,
2729,"I honestly can't believe I made it here. A few months ago it seems like an impossible goal- 30 days seemed impossible- but I'm here and I'm sober and it feels amazing. 

I remember when I was first lurking in the sub I use to click through posts of people who had some time to see what has changed for them as a result of getting sober, ya know, to see if it was really all it was cracked up to be. Holy hell, it is. 

First of all, I look a million times better. My skin is clear, my eyes are bright and sparkling, my face isn't puffy and bloated. Although I didn't lose the drastic amount of weight some people describe, I sort of replaced booze with food for awhile (which honestly I think is the best way to handle it at first - have whatever your heart desires as long as isn't booze) but since the new year I've just made some small, healthy, changes to my diet and I've easily dropped 6 lbs and counting :) 

Emotionally, I'm a different person. I'm not a sad, shaking, anxiety ridden mess anymore. I can go out to dinner with friends, I can pick someone up for a meeting I dont know that well, I can smoke a cigarette in front of someone without worrying about my hands shaking, I can hold a coffee cup, I can eat soup. I can go to class and participate, I can hand the person next to me the attendance sheet. 90 days ago, I couldnt do any of those things without a drink. 

That all being said, it certainly hasnt been a cake walk either. Early sobriety is an emotional rollar coster. You have to actually feel the feelings you've been drowning for so long, and it sucks, but its worth it. My sponsors says, ""The only way to get through it, is to go through it.""

I really truely, honestly want to thank this sub though. I know for a fact I would not be in this place today if I had not stumbled into IRC  and everyone had stopped what they were talking about to listen to me, and ever so gently explain to me that I may need to quit drinking. That they had been where I am and it worked for them. That it wouldn't be easy but I could do it, and more importantly, I was worth doing it. I may have found my way eventually, but it would have taken me many many more years of misery. I am forever grateful for the people in this sub, I don't know what I would do without you guys (wow this is getting mushy, but for real, I mean it.) 

Anyway, thanks for reading. Thanks for being here. Thankyouthankyouthankyou. "

2731,"To be really successful at NoFap, IMO you have to pretty much knock all sexual stimulation on the head, that includes porn, NSFW, and even the images in your head. I've spent many a night on NoFap cheating myself by having the boom boom pow with many hot mamas in my head. With one of the biggest problems with porn being the constant novelty of ever-differing babes and situations, its not hard to see how the imagination, arguably the most flexible and novel tool at your disposal, could be setting you back.

Whenever I get the urge for an online perv, or even just a quick fantasy or something, I just say to myself,

""Hang on, there's no women in the room right now, you're by your sad little self and you want sexual gratification from your own hand because you can't get any from a real human. How pathetic is that? Is that who you want to be? Is that who you would choose for other people to see you as? Why is it that there isn't a woman with you right now?""

As a result I have been pretty successful with temptation over the last two weeks, and I allow myself to peek all I want when I'm out and about without any guilt or feelings of failure, cos I know that I'm adjusting to a part of my life where I'm going to HAVE TO get some real-life action if I want to empty my love sacks."
2732,"If so, what was it and what about the job made you love it?"
2733,
2734,
2735,"Trying to explain to someone that fewer possessions and ""things"" actually makes one happier is almost always a tough sell. Our society has become so saturated with materialistic status that most people truly believe that having more stuff will make them happy. When they do get that brand new iPhone, and that top of the line 70"" LED television they wonder why they still feel so empty. 
Over the last year, I've sold what I'd say is approximately 50% of my ""stuff"". I had a move into a much smaller space and so initially it was forced. After selling many things, I began to feel an inner peace that I couldn't put my finger on at first. As time went on, more and more things went out the door as I was able to break my chains with them. Many expensive items that I held onto with white knuckles for a long time. Tonight I actually put my television on craigslist and am willing to accept an offer at probably less than what I could get for it if I really tried. The reason being that it is unnecessary! I have never in my life been one to sit in front of a tv and watch. My girlfriend and I watch a movie maybe once a week. Not enough to justify having this thing sitting around. I'm actually looking forward to getting it out of here and freeing up the space. 
I've discovered many things after getting rid of time wasters. I've taken up shooting and greatly enjoy it. I've found that I have more money to put into my motorcycle which is a passion of mine. I've begun to read books for the first time since high school. 
I feel bad for those out there who are still mentally chained to their possessions. I could now fit everything I own into one pickup truck bed and it's a great feeling. I've not felt a greater sense of peace and well being in my life. 
I greatly enjoy reading other's stories and ideas in this subreddit! Thanks for reading :)

EDIT: Allow me to clarify something for those who don't seem to be getting what I'm saying. This is not something that I started with by saying or thinking ""I want to be a minimalist lolz!"". This is something that I started long ago when I found that I like things simple and clean. I had never even heard of ""minimalism"" until I made a reddit account about a year ago and found this subreddit.  I don't believe that anyone can become a ""minimalist"" by actively practicing it or taking other people's advice. This is something that is grown into and is more of an awakening (if you will) than anything. I'm not getting rid of possessions in order to make myself happy. I'm simply finding that as I get rid of things I am becoming naturally more happy. That is what this post is about. Not preaching to anyone, telling anyone what to do, keep, get rid of or throw away. I don't care what others do. What your house and living space looks like is your business. I am sharing my experiences, so please keep your slanted naysaying drivel in another thread if you were considering posting it. "

Daftpunk64 has won, because he is the *only person* to follow all the rules. Most people didn't include which version of the game they wanted, which is really a shame. 

Also, I'm really not liking all this backlash I'm getting from what I decided to use as my contest rules. They're free games, and are pretty good games in my opinion, and people are complaining that it's asking too much to do. This sense of entitlement is really off-putting, and I'm almost positive that this is the last giveaway I'll be doing here. Sorry for the rant. 


----------------------------------------------------

So I bought the Desert to Sea Bundle, already have played both on Xbox, and Bioshock ran like shit on my computer, so I'm just giving both away!

**THE RULES:**

 I'm a huge Taylor Swift fan. These rules will reflect that. Also, I plan on giving away both to one person, but in the case of a tie, I will give only one, so specify which you would rather have in your post!

1. You have listen to some of her songs (I suggest starting with Speak Now), and pick out the three you like the most. Then, write out a short (3-5 sentence) blurb about why you like each of them so much.

2. Find a 1600 x 900 wallpaper of Taylor, and post the imgur link.

3. Post a self-drawn picture of how you feel after listening to Taylor. It can be either negative or positive, but both terrible and excellent art are preferred. 

4. Please just play it if you win.

This contest will close at about 9 or 10 Sunday morning EST. This is also my first post here, so let me know if I did something wrong. "

Been training for around 14~15 months. Decided to take some shots shortly after my workout and compare them to the pictures that I have taken in October, 2011. Hopefully this will motivate others, because I want to keep pushing myself further. 

Hopefully my transformation will motivate others. If you have got any questions, just ask :)

Diet consisted mainly of proteins and fats. Tried to consume as little carbs as possible. Here's a screenshot of my usual, weekday diet (I've ate slightly more chicken, because Sainsbury's were running an offer):

2752,"Just a quick note to say that yesterday was the ten year anniversary of the day I took control of my diet and weight to start keto (Atkins at the time)!  I weighed in at 225lbs when I was 23 and pretty much fit the bill of obese, sedentary, desk-bound technology worker.  My weight yesterday was 156 after just a bit of strict keto for a week after the onslaught of holiday food/travel/difficulty exercising.

My blood pressure on Tuesday was 117/73 and the three or four lipid profiles I've had over the years have all been normal.  

This stuff works and works well if you stick with it!  Hang in there and take control of your lives!


EDIT:

Some folks have asked about my programs and diet specifics and such so here goes:

* I did strict Atkins Induction for months after a good carb-purge of the kitchen!
* I probably lost the first 40lbs within the first 3-4 months with no portion control whatsoever (still strict keto)
* I attempted some exercise with circuit machines and jogging during this time with no real results on that front (diet is 80% of the battle!)
* I moved from Oklahoma (primarily a drive everywhere location) to Washington DC (primarily a walk everywhere location) in 2007 and easily lost another 20lbs just with the lifestyle change
* I started the [Built for Show](http://www.amazon.com/Built-Show-Body-Changing-Workouts-andLooking/dp/1583333193) weight lifting routine and did that for a year and a half or so with decent results (muscle gains, MUCH better free weight experience/form, and a lot more strength)
* But weight lifting wasn't slimming me down (duh) like I desired, so I switched it up yet again in 2009 to the [Four Hour Body](http://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Body-Uncommon-Incredible-Superhuman/dp/030746363X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1358194699&sr=1-1&keywords=4+hour+body)
* I learned a LOT from Tim Ferris and am a big proponent of his approach to ""Slow Carb"" (modified keto with some good carbs)
* I also started the [PAGG](http://www.fourhourbodycouple.com/2011/04/11/11-common-questions-faqs-about-pagg/) supplement stack to help burn a few extra pounds (this works but probably talk to your doctor first as it definitely can have interactions)
* 4-Hour Body ""Last Mile"" (SUPER strict, timed, portion controled keto) and PAGG allowed me to lose another 5-7lbs and approach my current weight
* Last New Year's resolution was the ""Couch to 5K"" program and I graduated!  But even being able to run a 5K on the low-impact machines at the gym still wasn't moving the scales any
* Then I moved on to [P90X](http://www.reddit.com/r/p90x) in early summer and LOVE it!  It will kick your butt.  You need to be fit before you even start this, but it works.
* So now I'm hovering around 155lbs, trying to combine all of this together, and still shave off the last of the belly fat
* I'm back on the keto horse this week after a sinus infection and plan to start some P90X with HIIT at the gym mixed in on odd days

As for diet and other notes, some tips/observations:

* Induction/keto-flu phases are ridiculously easy to get into if you're just starting out; Stick with it hardcore for at least 2-3 weeks to get fully into keto
* Once you've trained your body to do keto, it's really easy to get back into it even if you fall off the wagon and carb binge; Just go strict and you'll be back in no time
* Even at my worst of overeating, carb-binging, and alcohol (pretty much every holiday! amirite?), I can do strict keto for a week and be back at my nominal weight point
* I've never really been much of a sweets person so those were easy to kick; But I would punch a baby sometimes for a nice piece of garlic bread or a plate of pancakes!   Nobody is free of cravings!
* Set yourself up for success.  If you *know* your willpower will crumble, then get rid of all the carbs in and around where you work/live.  Whatever's handy is what you will eat, so why not make it almonds or cheese?
* Be careful of your knees/joints if you're heavy.  I hurt my knees by being stupid and trying to run/job long before my body was down to a manageable weight.  Diet first, exercise some if you must, but don't do the high-impact stuff until your joints can handle it!
* The closer you get to your target weight, the harder this is going to be.  I've had to change my program and really buckle-down quite a few times to keep making progress.  When you hit a plateau, BREAK OUT of it by switching up a bit.
* In the P90X and heavy workout cycles I've found I pretty much have to have carbs (good carbs like sweet potatoes or brown rice) to keep from being totally exhausted.  You have latitude with some carbs as long as you're working enough to burn them off!   Just be careful not to overindulge and slip out keto!

Feel free to ask me any other questions you may have :)  Keto on!

2754,"Female/ 20/ student/ 5""7 

In September, going into my second year of university, I weighed myself in at 196 pounds, the heaviest I had ever been in my life!  Throughout high school I had always easily stayed in shape, but since entering post secondary I found the stress causing myself to stay up late loading on carbs (Wendy's and chips were my favorite) and snacking non stop.  I also entered my first serious relationship, and I guess feeling comfortable, put on a ton of weight.  Dreading entering the 200s, I decided to change my lifestyle around and incorporate healthy eating.  However, living on a student budget out of my parents house made this task seem difficult and in two months I hardly lost 5 pounds.  I felt really hopeless and like I was doomed to always be overweight.  After a long conversation with my mom I decided to go on Weight Watchers, and she offered to pay (which I am forever grateful for).  I tried multiple meetings before finding one with a leader and group of people that I enjoy.  Now I diligently track every day and am only 5 pounds away from my first goal weight!  Weight Watchers has taught me so much in the sense of portion control (I'm in love with my food scale), getting active, and that you can eat anything you want, it just has to be in moderation.  It is an amazing program and I recommend it to anyone that, not only wants to lose weight, but also wants to forever change their lifestyle.

My other main teammate runs 18s and has run a 17:40 once. Third placer is upper 18s, fourth probably the same if he doesn't quit, fifth low 20s maybe.

2768,"Hello /r/starcraft !

I'm the kind of person to casually play a bunch of games and never really stick with one of them enough to improve and be good at (I've been going through CS:GO, LoL, HoN, Dota2 and SC2 in the past year+) so I decided to drop all of them except one (I was awful at CS anyways, HoN is pretty much dead and LoL/Dota 2 just can't keep me interested for more than a game or so at a time)

Anyways, after thinking about it for a bit I decided to get back into Starcraft. My new computer allows me to stream as well if I ever feel like it and I thought it'd be a good way to get feedback on my play (but watching gold players is pretty boring)

If anybody wants to play/practice, hit me up! I play Protoss/Zerg already and thinking about practicing some Terran and ladder as Random. My BNet info is **Turing.531** (NA).

So after about 12 months of following the keto diet I hit my goal weight of 160 pounds!

As for diet...I didn't follow macros or anything like that but on most days would keep fats from 90-100. kept carbs anywhere from 40-60 grams in a day and kept protein always above 160. After a while it felt extremely easy and it's like I wasn't even dieting.

Exercise: I tried to be as active as possible and since I love basketball and live right next door to a park I played in as many pick up games as I could. I also resistance trained on my Bowflex about 3-4 times a week to try not to lose too much muscle.

Overall it was a fun and new experience that i'm glad I did for myself. I had too much free time senior year of high school and said fuck it, I'm losing all this weight. Lost all the weight...got my dream girl...and life has now been awesome for me!"

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Because I dont want to be controlled by anything.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Because I want to meet the girl of my dreams (easier when you get into a streak and all women seem gorgeous for who they are, flaws and all), woo her, and by improving myself, prove to her that she is the only one for me and that I won't associate her with computer images.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Because I do this for myself and for my wife. She deserves a better me. If I focus on making her happiness the goal of my life then I'm doing it right. Nofap gives me the motivation and energy to exercise. I've lost 20 lb. I feel better and It's all for her.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Because life, as it turns out, is simply amazing when you're not stuck in a porn-induced haze.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Because I control my urges, not the other way around.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Because I realized that P&M is just another form of escaping the reality of life and all the bad effects it has on me (lethargy, laziness, non-focus, viewing women more like a piece of meat instead of persons), I want to keep on going with a burning heart. I want to be a better person.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Because life is infinity times better without PMO.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Because the pain killer causes the pain.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Because I let fear run my life from my teens through my twenties. NoFap has given me the energy and motivation to start living instead of running away, I don't want to lose that. And, you know... it'd be nice to dip my wick in at least one woman some time this century.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Because I've jerked it daily, sometimes multiple times a day since I was 13. I'm 26 now and really just want to see what life is like without it. I've seen the fruits of a decent streak and want to go further to experience it fully.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Because I'm tired of it ruining my self confidence and taking up all my time. What i think about is how I will be better once i stop letting sex control my life.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Because quitting is not an option, because I want to be better.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Because what keeps me going? It's simple. I do.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Because I want to better myself, and that is all there is to it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Because I hate having brain fog all the time.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Because I want to have better social skills.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Because sex with my girlfriend is 1000x better than PMO. Period.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Because I wanna keep my OCD at bay.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Because think of all the time you waste looking at porn and masturbating. You could be out being awesome.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Because the feeling of confidence and empowerment I get on a good streak keeps me going.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Because I want to have complete control over myself.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Because of the thought of becoming stronger than myself, not the one that existed long ago, but becoming stronger than I was yesterday, so on and so-forth.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Because it's too much pleasure for so very little gain.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Because life pops again. Flowers are beautiful. Women are irresistible. Learning is enriching. People are vibrant. Music speaks to the soul.
It's a different world and I'm not sure I want to go back to the matrix just yet. But if you preferred the rigid existence with about as much colour and charm as a slab of granite then fap away. At least you know what to expect that way :)

People always say that working out is good for your mental health and makes you feel better but I honestly don't feel much long-term benefit from it.  I might feel better for a few hours after working out but that's it.  In fact the times when I've worked out the most coincide with some of my most depressed periods.

What's your experience?  Maybe I just need to work out more.

I have heard this sentiment even in women's groups as the basis of ""why women matter"" as if I am supposed to get some sort of ego boost or pride as a woman because I can be impregnated, even though pregnancy is the last thing I want. I've always felt alienated by this sentiment as a CF female since I'm not going to procreate. Like I can't take pride in being a woman because I don't identify as a mother or want kids. I just wish women's value as humans wouldn't be so often reduced to ""can have babies"" by both men and women. Anyone else?"

It doesn't have to be the front-and-center issue of the story, and actually might be more interesting to have it as more of a secondary or background thing. I'm thinking intercultural in terms of race (elves/dwarves/non-human species etc) both on and off Earth. With strong cultural background differences between the two!

The only examples that come to mind for me are Spock's parents, the relationship options in the Mass Effect series, and the partially-qualifying Aragorn/Arwen.

A couple examples: 

""This began the process of slowly wiping out the elves, and the rise of humanity made a good, college try at finishing it.""

""When this technology wore out, they began dumping it in special containment areas. The mana, however, does not pay particular mind to the elves’ idea of containment, and eventually began to leak out into the greater world.""

2838,"Hey Grumplings, I seem to recall a little while back Jon and Arin talking about how they think people who want to do something need to just... you know, DO it. (I believe it was during an episode of Banjo Kazooie, though I'm not 100% sure)

I was just wondering if there's anything out there that you guys have decided to just go ahead and do because of that talk.

As the dm for the game I am playing in does so delight in killing pc's, I have begun once again making a back up character. As the title of this post implies I am intending to make a highly charismatic trickery cleric, my other main stat being wisdom for obvious cleric reasons.  My concept for the character is a charlitin changling conman who is also a follower of mask and well regarded among other followers.  

Seeing as how trickery clerics get no bonus proficiancies what so ever they are pretty much back line casters any way and with spells like blink and mirror image as well as an indestructible body double for delivering touch spells it kind of seems like there is no need for particularly good physical stats.  So I open the floor to you all, what do you think, also if anyone has any experience with a trickery cleric I'd love to hear of it."

2852,"As stated in the title, I wanted to share my conception story to give some hope to some of you who are feeling frustrated and defeated... I've been there too, but now I have a rambunctious toddler to chase around.

I had irregular periods until until my early 20's when they seemed to regulate after I started eating healthier and working out regularly. I started on BCP in my early 20's and had taken them for about 2 years before deciding to try for a baby with my husband.

I had read up on the fertility awareness method, so I knew what fertility signs to look for despite having a 60+ day cycle when coming off the pills. I was super excited when I saw a couple faint but definitely there lines on some First Response tests. I decided to wait to tell my husband until I picked up a digital. My period came before I ever could. This is the first time I've ever told anyone about that chemical pregnancy; I never even told my husband.

So of course, after that I figured I was doomed to chemical pregnancies, miscarriages, and horribly long cycles. I felt an immense depressing sinking in when my next cycle passed the 60-day mark again... and kept on going. I thought about going to the doctor, but was scared he would verify my fear that my lady parts would never work properly. I felt lost, scared, and alone. I tried to talk to my husband about it and he tried to reassure me that ""it will happen when it happens"". Of course, that didn't help me feel any better.

At around CD 70 (yes, 70) some fertility signs finally appeared. We timed sex right and I got my first digital BFP on cycle day EIGHTY. That baby stuck and I had a wonderful, uneventful pregnancy. 

I hope my story helps someone feel a little less shitty. Hang in there!  "

2861,"Let me start by telling a little about myself. I am 45 and am a typical middle class family man. My hair is receding (but not going bald, thankfully), I have more grey hair on my chest than black and I could stand to lose 20 lbs. I am happily married, 15 years this fall to a wonderful woman, with a mortgage on a house on the outskirts of suburbia.  We have two little boys, aged 10 and 7. I used to have a somewhat boring job in middle management at a manufacturing company until being laid off last year. My wife works, and we tightened the belt, so to speak, but we are slowly but surely slipping from surviving into losing everything as a real possibility if something doesn’t come my way soon. Savings are drying up.

I am not the type of person that lets my imagination get away with me. I don’t remember the last time I entertained a supernatural thought. I don’t enjoy horror or sci-fi or anything like that. I’m a realist. I have always been rational on everything.  But what happened the other night had me staying awake for a reason other than worrying about the future of my family. Here is the reason why I am posting my story here:

I quit smoking 10 years ago for a couple of different reasons: a) the birth of my 1st son was coming and b) my dad just passed away from lung cancer. Both major events in my life happened within a month of each other during the holiday season. My dad, well, I can never pass up an opportunity to talk about him. He was a great man. He was very well liked and greatly respected by everyone that ever met him. The reasons for this are because he was honest, hardworking, and quick to smile and slow to anger.  He found out he was sick the week of Thanksgiving when he went to the doctor for the first time in over a decade. Now, you got to understand something here. He never, and I mean NEVER missed a day of work in his life. He felt like what he described was a bad case of the flu. After missing one day, he went to work the next. He was a blue collar construction worker and can you imagine working physical construction while having the flu? He was tough like that. But at work, something else happened. He described it like pulling a muscle in his side. It wasn’t the flu that got him to go to the doctor but it was the excruciating pain from that pulled muscle. When the doctor did an x-ray, they found out it was not a muscle that was pulled but the pain he felt was part of the cancerous growth that had spread to most of his body pulling off of his ribcage.  They diagnosed with small cell lung cancer and told him he had less than six months to live. He refused chemo and radiation treatments, saying it was no use anyways, and passed away on Christmas Eve. Less than a month later, my first son was born. Quitting smoking was easy after that.

The first couple of years you stop thinking about loved past relatives every day and the frequency decreases with time. It’s just normal.  Now, like I said, the last year has been kind of rough. I have not been able to sleep the past few weeks as I am worrying about how we are going to pay the bills in the upcoming few months. We have about three months before things start getting critical. I took up going for walks at night to clear my head in the quiet that can only be found in the middle of the night on the sidewalks in suburbia. My wife understands.  I started thinking of my dad every night again. As I’m sure most can relate to, there are times you wish you could just talk to them one more time; especially in the times you could really use their company. I found myself in front of the 24 hour convenience store on the corner late one night.  Not exactly sure why, but I went inside. I walked up and down the aisles, looking at everything but not wanting to buy anything, before I walk up to the counter and asked for my old brand of cigarettes. Now anyone that has ever had to overcome an addiction knows, your mind can play tricks on you to the point where you can’t even trust yourself. My mind at the time told me it was perfectly alright and I allowed myself to believe it.

I kept that pack of cigarettes for almost a week unopened in my coat pocket. I knew I should just throw them away but I didn’t. Then, one late night, after walking around at 3am, I come back home and sit on the steps of my porch for a few minutes. I get up to go into my garage. Being unemployed had left me with a lot of time on my hands. Ever see a retired man’s garage? How every tool is hung on an outlined peg board and everything has a place? Yeah, my 2 ½ car detached garage was like that now. I walk into the garage and reach for a pack of long wooden kitchen matches out of a jar I had. I open the pack of cigarettes and went to light one up next to my wife’s Camry. What I saw then made me freeze. I don’t just mean freeze as in not moving, but I mean my blood ran cold and the hairs on nape of my neck stood on end. There, on the opposite wall, next to the driver door of my car, was a shadow darker than the rest of the shadow of the wall. There was enough light coming from the outside door light to just barely make out what is hanging on the wall. Like I said, I have spent enough time in my garage to know everything in there.  This shadow was dark; too dark to see through. It had an outline of a man.

I stood there, frozen in place, as I stared at this shadow what seemed like forever. Then it moved! It just shifted, like a person would if they transferred their center of balance to one side to begin a step. I bolted. I dropped my still unlit cigarette and ran inside the house. 

I sat on the couch, trying to get my heart to slow down. It was beating so fast and hard I felt it in my throat. My mind kept trying to rationalize what just happened:  Its 3am, I’m exhausted, I have insomnia, under a lot of stress, and was about to do something I was feeling very guilty about.  After about 20 minutes, my heart rate was back to normal and I was convinced I imagined the whole thing.  I feel asleep on the couch and woke up the next morning in great spirits as I got the kids ready for school. As I was getting them ready, a call comes in. It was from an employer wanting me to come in for an interview! I was ecstatic, to say the least. I finished getting the kids ready and got them in the car. When I walked around to the driver’s door, I saw something that made me forgot all the sane, reasonable explanations from last night. There, on the floor, was a smoked cigarette butt. It was the same brand my dad used to smoke.

2866,"Whenever I try to make a change in my life, I list all the reasons why that would be a rational change, and all the ways that help me make it. I read it every day in the morning, and in trying times during the day. 

My idea is that people really are rational and will listen to reason, but they are *slowly* rational, which means that they will have to hear reason many times before internalizing it (even if they agree with it). If you repeat the reasons not to fap many times, it will eventually become easier not to fap than to fap, because you will be very clear that you're only hurting yourself. 

Right now, when you fap, you are only marginally aware that it's bad for you, and you're using *willpower* to stop. You're thinking: ""I need to stop this. I can do it this time!"" Well, willpower doesn't work. Just like you need very specific tools to fix a specific car issue (and you won't do it by staring at it and willing it to fix itself), you need to think very specific thoughts which will make it clear that you're hurting yourself. Here are thoughts that worked for me, written in a text that I read daily:

---
I no longer wish to masturbate. Masturbating has plenty of consequences which I find unpleasant. 

Without masturbating I’d be rested all day and could deal with more challenging tasks and be more productive. That would make me happier in many areas other than masturbation. 

Masturbating makes me fall asleep harder, which in turn makes me a wreck the next day.  

If I stopped masturbating, I’d directly get more time to do other stuff each day. 

If I don’t masturbate sex gets better because of my full sacks, and I start actively seeking it instead of avoiding it. With full sacks, I am always ready and interested in sex, so I won’t miss any opportunities. 

Without masturbation I am more interested in females even non-sexually, so I make more intimate contacts, try harder, and am more charming. 

Research shows that imagining that you achieved something which you didn’t activates the same reward circuits as if you did, so you don’t try as hard to really achieve it. Without masturbation, I won’t imagine having sex with girls, and my positive tension will grow until I find a girl to have sex with.

Research also shows that testosterone is higher in people who don’t masturbate.

My memories are all that I have of my past. I remember none of my masturbation sessions, but I remember most of my lays. Less masturbating means more pleasant memories.

To stop myself from masturbating, I will always wear pants in the house.

It helps not to got to porn sites, and to stop myself whenever my hand goes to my penis.

I masturbate mostly in situations when I should be doing something else, so I flood my mind with an orgasm and lose the pressure to be productive. I no longer want to do that. I’ll be more satisfied in the long run if I ignore my wish to masturbate and go work instead.

I don’t really masturbate to release my urge for sex. The urge comes when I’m masturbating. I start masturbating so that I wouldn’t have to do other stuff, that I wouldn’t be bored, and out of sheer habit to masturbate when I’m on my PC. If that isn’t correct, then why don’t I get a wish to masturbate for weeks when I’m on vacation with my friends?

When it feels like I won’t make it, I know that the urge will soon pass and that I’ll feel very satisfied with myself. If I masturbate, I can be sure that an immense feeling of guilt will follow.

The longer I don’t masturbate, the easier it becomes. It will get easier with time and I’ll ditch it just like I did eating at McDonald’s and watching television.

I know that I don’t even want to masturbate. The unwanted consequences far outweigh the wanted ones. There is no desire, there's just the habit.

---


I removed some benefits/reasons that probably pertain only to me.

These are just an example and it's likely that some of these won't work for you, and some others will. That's OK. The point is, you need to think them often, otherwise you will soon forget them and start fapping again.


tl;dr: Repeating the reasons why you don't want to fap daily is far more effective than using willpower and believing that you will somehow just do it this time.

Help me think about this while I go check out the store. 

**EDIT**: Thanks for all the great suggestions! If everything goes well on Saturday (which I imagine it will) we might invest in a 3D printer. We have decided on three general stations for the trial event: one station of computers for them to make their own shapes and browse through thingiverse, one station of pre-printed 3D parts (arms, legs, heads, bodies) that they must fit together and design using acrylics and conductive paint, and one station for pictures to make busts. ALL of the other ideas were great, and if we end up investing in a 3D printer I'd love to try the more complex things. The printers will be constantly running, so the kids can watch everything as it goes. Pictures to come. 

In the meantime, *please* stop sending me hundreds of messages suggesting I print a dildo. It makes me uncomfortable on two levels: the fact that you think it's at all relevant, appropriate, or clever, and the fact that a dildo of that consistency and texture would be highly uncomfortable."

2878,"So obviously I don't share the beliefs of r/atheism, but we do share a common cause: combating religious abuse. I am the victim of multiple religious abuse incidents, as are some of my friends and also my fiancee. I don't need your pity, but I do need your help: Christians don't listen when I start talking about abuse. That's always something that someone else does, certainly not these good Christian men. ""Abuse"" is Westboro, I've heard it said. Or FLDS.

Abuse is an intrinsic part of a good deal of conservative Christianity. In my [blog](http://thediscerningchristian.wordpress.com), I define abuse as ""inflicted being-for-others,"" drawing the term from existentialism. An abuser tries to force the other to give up a portion of his/her identity and enslaves it to the abuser's will.

In Christianity, this sort of abuse often takes the form of one group turning assent to a proposition (say, the evil of homosexuality or some variant of Creationism) into a moral issue: if you disagree, you are immoral and need to be punished.

Abuse of this sort is so terribly pervasive in many Christian circles that it is practically invisible from the inside. If you clicked my blog, you will see that the latest post talks about a variety of abusive Christian organizations with an enormous public spotlight: Pastor Mark Driscoll of Mars Hill Church and Focus on the Family.

But the critiques fall on deaf ears. I don't know how to communicate how terribly abusive so many religious sentiments are. If r/atheism has any positive advice for identifying abuse and communicating about it to others, then please let me know."

I am atheist, she is Christian. Somehow we got into an argument about the bible being a source of morality, and I brought up (and proved the existence of) some of the ugly stuff such as how to treat slaves, sell your daughter, etiquette of rape, etc.

Rather than go the usual route of saying it is metaphorical, or that ""we don't talk about the old testament anymore"", she argued that maybe these things were ""ok"" in the right context. Or that there was some ""missing information"" that makes this alright. Clearly though, I did not have the ""whole picture.""

I was blown away. When is slavery or rape justified? In what context are these things made moral, even by god? These words are spoken by possibly the sweetest, most kind person I know.This display of denial is exactly the reason why I think the Bible is not only a poor framework for morality, but a downright backwards one. If this was written in any other form of text, she would immediately condemn it.

Is there a justification that exists that I don't know of? What are some of your thoughts on this kind of thinking? I can also provide proof of the bible's references to slavery, rape, etc - if anyone is new here.

TL;DR: She thought slavery & rape were justifiable in a context of the bible I didn't understand."

I think there are few words that feel as ugly and awkward as the word obese. Its the kind of word that always follows a sympathetic pause in the presence of the paunchy. It is so round and clinical and weighted down with taciturn lowness that it clings to a person in a way that squeezes and cripples him with what is simultaneously the most formidable and and the most elementary malady for a person to beat. January 5, marked one year since I resolved to change myself.This essay will probably be the most gushing and candid thing I’ve ever written, parts of this may seem attention seeking or boastful but I promise that this comes from the deepest, most sincere, and thought-worn parts of my heart. Its something I’ve had kicking around in my head for the better part of 15 years; this is the eulogy for my obesity.


Size has always dominated me, I began to chub around the fourth grade. I wouldn’t say that I was by any means a too-sad kid but I do think that feeling sad was a trigger for me. As a kid I had a difficult time finding a place where I felt like I was supposed to be. Whenever I would venture a try at something new, I would inevitably leave inadequate. I would feel bitter about being rejected by girls or I would feel sad about not being able to keep up with boys. In response I withdrew and went to food. As I grew up, I never felt right and I never I had anything that was mine with which to excel…I would fantasize about accomplishment and taking ownership of the kind of charisma and strength that would enamour me to those girls and make myself a hero in the minds of those guys, but I had lost so much ground over time that the idea of changing anything was daunting. It felt like my life was looming over me and I used food and humor as a means to swat it.


Gaining weight was mostly gradual with a few sharp spikes. It went on slowly until one day I realized that I was a fat kid and at once the idea got stuck in my head. I remember this feeling of compliance like:""well, this is me now."" As I grew older and boundaries widened, I became heavier. I would ride my bike to the Meijer on Clyde Park when it had a McDonalds in it and I would eat a Double Quarter meal Super-Sized and a twenty-piece chicken nuggets, turn around and ride home. This secret meal would lay on top of everything else I eaten during the day and I would enjoy it with stealth in my mind. It didn’t help that I was also slow to develop socially; I didn't have friends yet and food became music for me. It entertained and occupied me. I would go to movies by myself (which I loved doing) I would devour my lonely popcorn and inhale my propitious Pepsi. With every little bit of freedom I enjoyed, my weight gain would apex and level off. When I got my first job (at a pizza joint) I had tons of free food and money to spend on whatever I liked, when I got my license I could travel farther for different brands and combinations of fast food. Every bit of independance further cemented my habits.


Eventually I did develop a bit of a social lean but I still had a hard time accepting myself to my peers, I always felt like my stature stood between us. For example, one year we went to Michigan Adventure, I hadn’t thought much about the seat in a roller coaster and and never had a problem with a lap bar, but then I got in line for The Corkscrew. We waited eagerly and when the time came I walked up to the cart and looked inside and I thought ""shit."" I sat down next to a friend and it was tight but we were both able to sit. I reach up to pull down the shoulder harness and it wouldn’t click. My chest is too far from my back to get the harness to lock. I want to get out but instead an employee comes to me and tries to help by pressing it into me while I 'suck it in' No dice. I stood up and walked away with all the eyes on my back. I held the ride up and I was that fat kid that didn’t fit so I watched my friends ride the coaster from the sidewalk. It was the first time my size made me feel t isolated in front of someone. My attitude was to quietly tack roller coasters on to a list of things I couldn’t do. Eventually I out grew movie theater seats, airplane seats, and ‘Big & Tall’ sections in the mall and I passively waved goodbye to all of them.


And time just passed by - I built powerful, lasting, and comfortable relationships. I worked and had fun but never really achieved anything. I had quiet goals but all of the things I wanted for myself came to be plain conversational fodder, things you get drunk and dream about out loud. Everything I wanted was so public and everything I was was so private. I wanted to act and I wanted to be a comedian. I did open mics and it left me disgusted and exposed, it was a sort of exhilarating misery that kept you facing the goals you pushed away. I gradually lost momentum and just sort of stalled. Life for a few years was like a room dimly lit by the flickering light of a TV. It was quiet, and private, and comfortable. I remained stealthily obsessed with food. It occupied my mind. The flavors and textures and that feeling of occupation in your core gave me a sense of contentment that was so durable that it became ever-present in my life.


I haven’t always lacked a sense of the need for change. Periodically, I would have manic bouts of conviction and backbone. I would face the world and strive to be social, and better, and healthy. I would purse comedy again, I joined gyms, I sought and gained relationships...complacency though eventually had me back in my room eroding from a habit bordering agoraphobia. Eventually I realized that I wasn’t the possessor friends I once was and I became aware of the cheerlessness I felt for myself and that revealed to me the delicacy of the relationships I had. I was pushing people away from me so that I could revel in my faults. I began to see the folly and futility of so many of the years behind me. I became morbidly mindful of my mortality; I would imagine a roommate finding me dead and how they would react. How my family would react. In that, I realized that I’d lived so absent mindedly for so long that I had become OK with being dead when I was 40 and had subconsciously planned to be alone and idle for whatever time I had left. I’d let indulgence and apathy become intuitive.


A dramatic shift in my mindset came to pass around summer 2011. It was also around this time that I, as none of my friends or family knew, auditioned for a weight loss reality show. On the show, overweight men and women are taken away to a fitness sanctuary where they are taught healthy habits and exercise and exercise and exercise ... it was much like a real-life adult version of the movie Heavyweights. While gone, participants don’t communicate with family or friends and then, after an agonizing and heart lifting episode is complete, they are revealed to friends and family in a new body and attitude. I wanted to be a part of that show and thought I had it. I was interviewed and inline to be a part of the show when, abruptly, the series was put on hold and the new season never materialized.

I was devastated. I had poured my future into this idea that I could be taken away and fixed. That I was going to leave and come back as a new person for everyone to hold up cheer for. I had built up tremendous optimism and lost it all just as quickly. I went right back onto the destructive beat I had just left. Looking back, not making it on that show broke something for me and pushed me to get bad enough that I could get better.


Fortunately it only took about six months, I grieved the loss of my spotlight and my champion transformative moment and during that time reflected soulfully about who I am to the people in my life, who I am to myself, and most importantly recognized that I have it in myself to become the kind of person I want to be: I want to constantly be aware of my potential. I want to be a man that knows and practices right from wrong. I want to modestly inspire goodness, optimism, and effort in people; I want my integrity and my character to be something worth holding up. I want to be external and in the lives of people and I want people to feel that having me in their lives is a thing of value. In order to realize these things I had to accept accountability for what had misrepresented my capability and demeaned my resolve for so long. It wasn’t my weight, it was my attitude about life and an enduring lack of enthusiasm for the future.


I took responsibility for my well being one year ago, I weighed 420 pounds, I wore a XXXXXL dress shirt and 48 jeans. My life and the way I lived it literally changed overnight and hasn’t stumbled. I began by eating a calorie restricted diet and eventually shifted to focus on lower carbohydrates. For exercise I started by walking three miles a day. I would take the bus to school, get off walk a ways and get back on further down the route. Once spring rolled around I began to bike. Those rides progressed from two, to six, to ten mile rides, mostly to and from school. Soon the distance between school and home wasn’t clear or long enough so riding became a purposeful thing rather than utility. I rode and rode. By the end of the summer I had joined the half century club having ridden over fifty miles in one ride. In August I began running using the Couch to 5k program and ran my first full 5k on November 17 and putted along to finish my first 10k on December 15. As of today I have lost 178 pounds, wear a large and 34 jeans. I am stronger and faster than I’ve ever felt myself be. I feel appreciation and optimism in everything that I do and I sense that this is the way life should feel. I’ve still got a lot of work to do but at this point the habits have rooted and the education that I’ve gained over the last year will nurture them. I cannot see my life going backwards, this is who I was always supposed to be.


I’ve spent most of my life planning and daydreaming without action and now everything seems so attainable.This is why I write today, I’m ready to say goodbye to that old life now and to focus on maintaining goal oriented momentum and pushing harder so that the strength in my musings becomes the strength in my character. I can do better, I can do better. I can be the Greatest Man in the World.


Thank you to Mom, my Dad, Jerry, My brothers Eric and Adam, Jessica, Marshall, Corey, Colby; you guys specifically have given me clarity and always been frank with be about delicate things. And to Britt, Allen, Jen, Margie, and Alex, you guys give me the happiness I need to suck it up and do it. This might all seem overly sentimental but I only plan on doing this once and you’ve changed my life in ways that can’t really make sense to you.


Part of the audition process for the reality show I mentioned was to create a series of videos focusing on different aspects of my life. I edited one of them and am keeping a few private, but as for the rest, I don’t see a reason to keep it closeted anymore, I feel like that person is gone now. I uploaded these in May 2011, until now it has been accessible only to the producers of the show. For those interested, I have the links listed below. I think they are a thought-provoking relic.

I colonised this planet a while back, and it has some random natives that you can see everywhere.

I later got into a war, and the person i was fighting was doing full bombardment on this planet, and nearly wiped out all my humans on it. 

The last human population is 32/92 growth, and hasnt grown at all for ages. 

To try to fix this I built a robot to see if he could farm some food to help the humans grow, but it didnt help. 

As you can see the rest of the planet is these weird things and i cannot purge them...

Is there absolutely anything i can do?"

2888,"After the first 'practice' of a gunman incident at the kids' school, a couple of dads showed up and were at the main entrance, allowed to hang out at the playground. Just to be there.

School says kids' anxiety went down and kids said they felt safer with the dads there.

Since, more dads have volunteered to come to the school. Help in out in the library, eat lunch with the kids, extra playground monitors, door watching to make sure the doors are locked from the outside that should be, stuff like that.

So now we have a program officially in place where dads can sign up for shifts and positions in the school on their days off and stuff. the school says that since this has started, bullying is non existent, no one's getting hurt on the playground either. At the Jr. High, no one's fighting in the halls, and when they sit with the kids that sit alone at lunch, other kids come and sit and the quiet kids are now participating in class way more.

Fathers, involved with their school having a very surprising and measurable effect there. Shocking. 

Utah has allowed teachers to carry without notifying the principal, principals don't care. Same policy with the dads. "

2893,"After seeing all the weight loss pictures, I though I would share mine as well! Although I ate mostly healthy food, my weight was just keep on climbing every year after 5th grade. At the end of my freshmen year of high school, I was over 200 pounds with a lot of health and skin issues. I was pretty much at rock bottom at the time with all the looks and teases I got from school and extended family. I mean how often do you see an obese Asian. :P I tried diet herbal medication during my sophmore year, which help me lose 30 pounds. However, my body became tolerant of the herbs and I stayed around 160-170lbs. During junior year of high school, I regained back 20 pounds after a family member passed away with a period of emotional eating. I don't have any pictures from the height of my weight and I would rather not see one. The picture was taken in Junior year for graduation when I weight aroud 170 pounds (I lost the 20 pounds I gained after breaking up with my ex). 

After years of struggling with various diets and some desperate (not so smart) ways to lose weight during college, I notice the toll it taken on my body. After all the yo-yo weight gain and lost, I lost 2/3 of my hair and my skin was extremely saggy. It wasnt until the recent past 2 years, I finally found the healthy way to lose weight and keep the weight off. I do not limit myself to just steamed veggies and salads (without dressing and toppings). I eat everything, but watch the portion size and calories count to make sure I eat a balance diet. The change really helped my cravings and made me much happier in life. I researched and tried out different skincare products and turned my horrible skin condition around. Now people are amazed and constantly complimenting my skin. I finally found peace with myself and my weight after struggling with my weight for more than 10 years now. I learned that you're doing this for yourself and not for others. It doesn't really matter what other people do or say, the real motivation and determination comes from within. However, I do love how the people jaws drop after seeing the new me. ;) I have 10 more pounds to lose and hopefully it will be by the end of 2013. :)

2898,"Looking at my post history, you can pretty much see that for the last week and a half, I was tested every 4 days or so (I post every time I overcome a major urge to make myself feel good about my triumphs). This was the worst test I've ever had to date. The rationalization was just overwhelming. My brain was telling me it would feel good and that I'd feel relieved afterwards. It told me it was normal and that it was a good habit. I succumbed for a while. Watching magic tricks on youtube for a brief study break turned in to dirty youtube searches. I maneuvered my way past K9 a bit and started clicking on videos. For some reason, I just couldn't watch them. I could read the comments and click related vids, but I couldn't watch them. I opened up NoFap to stop myself, but it was loading slowly. Kept clicking but not watching vids, waiting for NoFap to save me. Then, I went to the bathroom. HUGE mistake. I initially wanted to shit and distract myself from fapping by shitting (why would I think the bathroom was a good place to distract myself from my penis?), but once I got in there, my mind started rationalizing. I went out of the bathroom, and got on NoFap. I read a couple stories, but then a huge urge came. I walked to the bathroom as a slave; I had to do my master's work. Hand about an inch from my dick, a thought popped into my head. Fuck God. Being religious (don't downvote), this startled me. Why would I think this? Then I remembered that I promised him I would never fap again, and I had already broken this promise twice. I tried to brush the thought aside, but more of them came: Can you really throw this away for a little bit of pleasure? You're going to hate yourself. Don't do it, you feel so much better without it. One month. ONE MONTH! That's huge. You cannot and will not do this. 
My rationalizing brain gave up. Not only did I not masturbate, but I don't think I could've. I've come too far to turn back, and I don't think I can. I realize that this is the closest I've come to relapsing on this 30 day journey. I'm disappointed, but I'm also proud. I was able to defeat the urges in full force. I can do this.

TLDR: Worst urge I've ever had and literally could not give in."

The criticism I've received from my mainline denominational higher-ups is ""Where's the good news in your sermon?""

So I'll be giving a persuasive speech arguing that the Galactic Empire were the good guys in the Star Wars films, and I need your help. I need sources to use in my speech in order to get a good grade, so if any of you can respond here with some thoughts on the topic it would be greatly appeciated!

The three topics that I will be talking about are:

The Jedi Order is actually a terrorist organization. I will be using power point and will make analogous comparisons to ISIS for this point.

The Empire was good for ending the ineffectual and corrupt bureaucracy of the Republic.

The Empire strove for peace and order in the galaxy.

2911,"Seriously. Do like 90% people really buy the bigger model, because that's what I read on this sub all the time? Is it really THAT much better? I liked the smaller model for the compactness but it seems like everyone likes the Plus one a lot more. Should I really consider just getting 7+ instead and deal with it?"
2912,"A little bit about myself: I am an 18 year old male attending community collage.  I started PMO when I was 11 years old.  

Looking back on it all, I was addicted from the start, but I did not come to realize my problem until a few years after I started PMO.  Around age 13 my dad found out that I was watching porn, and he tried to help me stop the only way he knew how, by putting content blockers on our computers at home.  I love my father, and he has been a huge help in my life, but how naive he was to think a porn blocker could keep me out!  I won't go into details about how I did it, but circumventing the software was pathetically simple.  

After that my dad never found out about the porn again, and life went back to ""normal"", but there is a catch.  As we all know here at /r/nofap (and /r/pornfree) addictions grow.  By the time I was 15 I'd become a depressed, self-loathing, and hateful individual.  What the next two paragraphs have to say is horrible, and I will carry the weight of these memories to my grave.  

I hated who I was.  I hated that I could not gather enough courage and strength to stop my PMO addiction.  I tried to stop more times than I can remember,  perhaps more than 50 times I tried.  The longest time between relapses was one week.  During this stretch I thought I might have been able to beat the PMO, but I broke down on day 8 and binged until my penis was bloody.  This is who I was.  On top of the addiction I became extremely physically sick.  At one point I had to receive multiple emergency blood infusions to keep my heart from stopping.  

I was a wreck in every way.  And I helped kill one of the only friends I ever had.  This friend came to me asking for help, I knew he suffered from extreme depression, and he needed someone to talk to, but I told him that life is shit and nothing matters.  He ran his car off the freeway later that night, a clean cut vehicular suicide.  The next day when I talked to his girlfriend she told me what had happened, and I laughed.  I laughed when I learned that one of my only friends in the world killed himself.  

It is impossible for me to put into words how disgusted I am with who I was.  The old me was a monster.  I am honestly surprised I never raped or sexually assaulted anyone.  The only thing holding me back was shame.  The one thing I held onto was my desire to please my dad.  I did not want him to know who I was on the inside.  I went to church every Sunday and Wednesday, I talked the christian talk and acted like I was fine.  I became an amazing liar.  I could get anything past almost anyone.  During church I would sit and look at all the hot high-school girls around me.  I would sit there hiding my erection as I fantasized about these girls.  

This hell lasted for a few years until one day I decided to kill myself.  I knew I was sick in the head, but I did not want help, I wanted an end to the pain, shame, and total self hatred.  But I could not go through with it.  I could not even bring myself to end myself!  Do you have any idea what that's like?  Being so totally controlled by your own body that you can't not even destroy yourself?  And so at age 17 I allowed myself to be a slave to my body.  I created a schedule: 
Wake up, go to school, come home and watch porn for half an hour, do homework, eat dinner, play video games, watch porn until I got too tired to continue, go to sleep, repeat.  I became a robot.  Following the same schedule... day after day.

Well, something weird happened about 3 months ago.  Some random dude I had never met came up to me and changed my world.  He talked to me, made me feel like I had worth and he asked me questions.  Now,  to all the liars out there, you know that a question is very dangerous.  If you don't have the right tools in place and a proper cover story, a simple question can ruin everything.  Well, when A (my new friend) started to ask me questions... I felt too tired to come up with a good cover story.  So I told him the truth.  The next day, he introduced me to a friend of his, K.  Well, K is the most amazing girl I have ever met in my life.  In one moment I felt like something in my mind just snapped.  I knew that I wanted to date this girl, but I also knew who I was.  So I went to war.  I deleted all the porn off my computers, I got honest with a few fantastic older guys I know, and I removed every source of temptation from my life.  I decided for myself, for the first time in 7 years that I would do what ever it takes to make myself a better person.  The rest is history.  

After 90 days of absolutely zero porn of any kind (not even playing video games like skyrim), no masterbation, no edging, and nothing even remotely sexual in any way, I am a new person.  I have changed from the deepest part of my being.  Nothing is the same.  I used to lie to anyone and everyone about anything, now I can't get myself to say anything dishonest, even if I wanted to... I just cant.  Also, I have self confidence.  Prior to October of last year I had only one friend, and we rarely hung out.  Now, I have a core group of four friends who I would do anything for, and I am making new friends everywhere I go.  This sounds silly, but the world is a beautiful place!  I always walked around shoulders hunched and head down.  Now I make eye contact with everyone and maintain perfect posture.  I have girls telling me that I look good, and some people who knew the old me don't recognize who I am anymore.  One guy I have known for a few years had no idea it was me when we chatted yesterday!  I used to have horrible acne, no style, no personality, bad hair, and no ability to change who I was.  Now I look in the mirror and I like who I am.  I still need to gain a bunch of muscle mass, but other than that I am one sexy beast!  Finally, I have drive.  I will gain 25 pounds of muscle this year,  I will get good grades in school,  I will memorize a 1000 word poem by the end of next week.  Not because I need to (although the grades I kinda do need), but because I want to. 

So, moral of the story to all my brothers and sisters who take up the fight, if I can do it, you can do it.  Seriously, if the fucked up piece of shit that I used to be can change, you can do it too.  Now, the first thing you need to do if you want to start this journey is to get yourself a friend that you know you can trust, and lay your situation out to them.  YOU WILL NOT win this fight if you do it all on your own.

Presumably, the first goal of the website would be to build itself.  Then you could have a process of people collaboratively writing code with that website as their interface.

2941,"I feel that this happens to many of us who sit daily. We go along and things are great, we get some states of relaxation and learn about ourselves, we start to be kind to others, we are mindful when doing some things, and we are a bit happier. Then all of a sudden (3 years into my practice) we hit a wall, or multiple walls. We just don't want to sit anymore. It is really hard to bring ourselves to the cushion, we are sitting for less time, worrying about the clock, doing other things instead of sitting even though we have all the time in the world. I have read in many many places that this is a ""good"" sign. This is our ego really holding on trying to pull us back to the comforts of delusion and clinging and if we just power through and sit, that ego will break down! But my gosh, it is really tough to do. Does anyone have any tips? And I do not belong to a sangha as there are none where I am from ugh.

Also, I am in need of a good pick me up dharma book. I was thinking of reading something by Ajahn Chah...I have read a lot of Kornfield. Has anyone read the new Pema Chodron book? I would just like something to make me smile and inspire my practice. "
2942,"What I mean by this is how can you not be always scared of death, knowing that you won't exist anymore if you die? I probably would be an Atheist if it wasn't for my fear of death, how do you do it?"
2943,
2944,"And by god game I mean games like [Black & White 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_%26_White_2).
So, anyways, I'm looking for a god game which grants the player most ""power"" in their hands, because I'm a dirty Megalomaniac who can't get enough of this sweet essence of life and death.

Power = ability to do things, for example, wipe out an entire race or planets, create life, rule nations and such.
Thanks in advance."
2945,"Mine are:

* Lose the last 6 lbs. I started at almost 170, and I'm nearly to my goal of 140.

* Do 5 unassisted pull-ups. Right now I have 70 lbs of help on the machine.

* Bench 75 lbs. Right now I'm benchin' the bar.

* Hold a plank for 10 minutes.

* This one's more vague: Get in good enough shape that I can start aerial silks.

What about you? What are your goals for 2013?

2950,"I recently turned 27 and suddenly I notice that when someone mentions an achievement or milestone someone close to my age has achieved, I subconsciously compare where I am to them. It isn't fair- I know wholeheartedly that every person's life journey is different and there are no benchmarks to success... but here I find myself nonetheless. 

There really isn't a major point or question I want to pose in this post but maybe someone else is feeling the same or just knowing it's out there will help me process these feelings of inadequacy. 

I am happy for others successes and achievements and I don't covet what they have; it's more of me questioning what I've done with my life and where I could've done something different. 

I am on the precipice of going back to school and making changes  that will in turn improve my and my family's life in the long run. 
I know the only way to get to where I want to be is to keep going and moving forward, I'm just having a hard time quieting those thoughts and feelings.

2975,"I've been trying over and over again to get a long streak but I keep relapsing every the time. I've relapsed more times than I can remember. I'm 16 and I've tried to stop fapping for about a year now because in the afternoon I started to feel dizzy and lightheaded, then I realized it started when I started fapping so I tried to stop. I've tried so many times but my longest streak has only been about 10 days. Everytime I fail it takes so much effort to pick myself up again because I'm finding it harder and harder to find motivation. Whats worse is that abstaining doesn't actually seem to be helping as I'm becoming more and more depressed each day (maybe a longer streak mine show some improvements). I don't know what to do, I don't even fap that much and I only started less than 2 years ago. 

Help, advice and support would be extremely appreciated."

The foundation series by Asimov

Dune (although to this day I claim Dune for fantasy vs sci-fi)

I’ve read a lot of other sci-fi that was great but did not have the world building aspects.


What else gives you that sprawling epic world building feel we all seem to live so much in epic fantasy."
2982,[deleted]
2983,"One of the things I’ve always liked about Dune or LoTR is that it feels like the stories are taking place in a long existing universe with a deep history too it.   Civilization has existed for thousands of years and the weight of all that history surrounds the characters and plot. What are the good epic sci-fi  books/series that capture that feeling, where the author has gone to the trouble of fleshing our the universe that his characters inhabit. The foundation trilogy also had that feel to me but I bounced off it for some reason."

I don't have the other new gun (shotgun) yet, but could this be further confirmation that Calus has looked upon/interacted with the Darkness itself, or something else? He includes ""worms"" with his list of those who were wrong, so maybe he's seen some other power that we don't know about yet.

2993,"So far, a lot of different types of anime have changed me and made me start trying new things. Couple years back, I started playing guitar because I watched Beck (No matter how much I practice I still suck). I play piano thanks to a bunch of different songs and openings that are found in my favorite anime series (with the help of my friend who is a piano tutor). I now train harder and workout better than ever because of Bakki the Grappler. The World God Only Knows has made me start playing and finishing my games more efficiently (I tried God Mode, to difficult). I also study harder thanks to many cliche anime situations that are held in high school. So what anime did you guys watch that made you try something new or made you better?

EDIT: Wow this really took off! I'll make sure I take the time read all of your responses.

EDIT 2: Lots of fighters, cooks, and musicians here. I'm blown away by the amount of people who were inspired by just watching anime, I'm proud of being apart of this subreddit. "
2994,"I should start with a little information, I'm 6', male, 21 and 320lbs (probably less now) and started my new life 2 weeks ago.

How do you guys deal with your family in your journey to loose wait?  I ask because I am currently in University but the hardest part I've found wasn't the reduced portion sizes, watching the calories nor motivation to go to the gym, but surviving family.  I come from a rather large family (on both sides) and because of this there never seems to be any motivation to loose weight, oth my parents and brother are highly overweight but don't seem to be bothered by it.  

Now, due to personal reasons I've had to go home last weekend and the middle of last week, both times my family would gouge on crap; biscuit, cakes, ice cream and food to the point my mom yelled at me for refusing fast food (it was 10pm and she said she didn't want to cook (I had said previously that I would make something myself when I get home)).  Once of the biggest problems, however, is when they are sat watching TV, eating biscuits, cakes and sweets they would continuously ask if I wanted some and then before I can answer say stuff like; 
""no, do wont want any your on a diet.""

I am proud to say that I turned down everything offered to me, watching my dad and brother polish off a full bag of Maltesers and Minstrels and took it upon myself to cook healthy meals (chicken, lots of veg and homemade wedges, etc) the nights I was home.  

So, as I asked above.  How do you deal with family when you have to go home?  I'm worried that when I go home for the summer I will give in because of my families attitude, putting the weight I've lost back on  and the life style change will have been for nothing.

Thanks for reading

**TL;DR: Started losing wait, family going to be a stumbling block, how do you deal with your family?**"
2995,"Title says it all! I loved 2001: A Space Odyssey, Rendezvous with Rama, and Hyperion precisely for the ancient, unknowable, and mysterious nature around the ancient structures within the books. The monolith, Rama, and the Time Tombs (and to a greater degree, the labyrinths in Hyperion) all fascinated me. I'm looking for more scifi that focuses on the remnants of alien civilizations, be it tech floating in space, cities abandoned on planets, or anything in between. I'd love to hear of novels or short stories that contain these common themes. Thanks a lot guys!"

So, how do I look past them and keep my beliefs up?

We would share our earth with another sentient species. Would they gain the rights that every human being has because they are now sentient?

What if the augmentation is so good that they become smarter than humans?

3025,"28 year old mother of two. 85 pounds lost in 8 months 

I've never been a tiny girl.. I'm not the one with the tiny little frame and size 0 jeans. I have curves.. But at 250 pounds I was fooling myself into thinking I was just ""curvy"". I was an idiot. 
In April 2010 I was putting on a pair of shoes and while bent over to lace them up I quickly got light headed and was unable to breathe, just from the simple fact that I was too fat to reach my feet! 
Something snapped in my head. 
I spent the next 4 months depressed and making excuses as to why I was overweight.. ""I had a kid"", ""I don't have time to workout"", ""I don't have time to cook healthy"" 
By November 2010 I had finally made the decision to change my future rather than make more excuses to cover up my laziness. 
I started walking, then jogging, then running. I found an amazing deal on some gym equipment and put it in my living room to make myself do it. I was following a low calorie diet and just basically holding myself accountable for my actions. 
The weight came off fast at first with many plateaus in between. 
By July of 2011 I had lost 80 pounds... And what happens when you lose weight and feel good about yourself? You make babies, duh! Lol 
I wasn't thrilled about the fact I would put weight back on, but happy to be a mother a second time. 
I tried to keep running even through the pregnancy but quickly realized I couldn't handle it. By the time my baby girl was born I was up 60 pounds! This time was a little different because I knew what it took to get it off and I knew there was no sense in making excuses. In June 2012 I got the ""ok"" from the DR to resume regular activity and off I went! Started running again but I was slooooooow as could be. With an average of an 11:30 min mile. But I was persistent, I downloaded MyFitnessPal and tracked my calories and exercise burns. 
By November 2012 my running pace was up to 8:30min miles and I had lost 50 pounds. I was feeling good again. I started ""insanity"" to help me up my progress and I saw amazing changes in my body! 
Over the last few months I have dropped another 35 pounds for a total of 85 pounds lost. I am at a running pace of 7:15min (flat) and I am training for a half marathon in May. I have finished ""insanity"" once and continue to do it every other day just to help me keep my muscle tone. My goal is to lose another 7-10 pounds and go for a full Marathon in Columbus Ohio this fall. 

I know what it is like to be obese.. I know what it's like to want the change but not have the drive to do it... But you have to.. You're the only one that can change YOU! More important that the weight loss and the better looks is my health! I am in the BEST shape of my life. 
If you want it go get it! Don't let anyone stop you.. Especially yourself! 
Patience and perseverance pays.

3033,"Be it the Letts/Dicks era of UNIT and *Avengers*esque intrigue, the Williams/Adams run of whimsical and lighthearted romps, the Davies/Gardner camp yet endearing, emotional soap opera (or should I say space opera), or Moffat's fairytale, fantastical timey whimey adventures, which era (or eras) of Doctor Who do you think of with the most fondness? 

Myself? As much as I love the current Moffat days (yes, come at me with bashing, I've loved everything from series 5 to now), my pick is the Hinchcliffe/Holmes era, seasons 12 to 14. Short as it was, it was fantastic; a series of adventures that took dark, adult themes and Gothic Horror elements to create some of the most unique television ever. The Fourth Doctor, with either the wonder that was Sarah Jane or the badass breath of fresh air that was Leela, was always on top form, and these seasons illustrate why he is one of my favorite Doctors. 

I'm also completely in love with the first two seasons of the Second Doctor, another favorite (they just went through about two different producers and at least three script editors...). The Second Doctor is probably my favorite of all the incarnations, and the relationship he builds with Jamie and Victoria (once Ben and Polly go) is truly something special. This was the era which first introduced the Cybermen, the Yeti, the Ice Warriors, and saw two of the best Dalek stories in the entire show's history. I'm also a sucker for black and white cinematography, and I love the atmosphere it gives Sixties DW. The fact that most of this era is completely lost (thank god for the *Lost in Time* set, audio tapes, and telesnaps) is an unfair twist of bitter fate. "

You might notice in the sidebar that we are one maester fewer today. /u/deodrus, one of the original and perhaps the most influential and defining moderators of this subreddit in regards to the look and feel of our community, has resigned his post.

I know: Sworn Brothers are supposed to serve for life. But Deodrus served for several lifetimes when you take into account all that he did here. He was the one who took my crappy coding and turned it into the awesome shield-system we now currently enjoy. He was the one who took one look at our CSS stylesheet (again, mostly my mess) and declared, ""Not on my watch."". He was the one who turned a two-bit, amateur subreddit into a professional looking place that has become the envy of many other subreddits.

Deodrus was, and remains, a machine. His hard work and dedication to our community will be remembered for as long as the Wall stands. But now he has to turn his attention elsewhere and so he wishes to resign his post. Sad though it is to do I have accepted his resignation. We are all a bit smaller as a result but I, for one, wish him good tidings and best of luck as I recall all that he has done to make /r/asoiaf what it is today.

At the risk of embarrassing him I would ask all of you, new to the Wall and veteran crows alike, to use this thread to thank him for his service. Perhaps share a fitting quote from one of the books or just reflect on how awesome his contributions have been.

Thanks for everything /u/deodrus. While I'll miss you as a fellow maester I'm glad, at least, that you'll be around still as a crow.

I have for you a most wonderful giveaway of Saints Row the Third Complete Edition.  All of the DLC and whatnot.  In order to get away from the typical formulaic ""pick a number here's your game"" thing, I'll be giving the game to the person that makes me the happiest (sexual favors notwithstanding)

SO!  Here are the requirements:

**1.** You must be cordial and have proper grammar/sentence structure

**2.** You must link to your steam profile (please do not just have your profile name.  It would be very convenient to include an actual link)

**3.** Any sort of media is acceptable.  I'll take anything (again, offers of your sexual services are flattering but will ultimately be declined)

**4.** Say whatever you think will help your cause.  

*Winners will be chosen by Tuesday evening 11:59 p.m. central time.*

Here is a [link](http://steamcommunity.com/id/cannibal_banana) to my profile if you need some assistance.

Also, I will be giving away Bioshock 2 at a later date because I accidentally bought two copies of it...

That's it, folks!  Happy New Year and good luck to all!

__________________________________________________________________________________

Edit:  you **MUST** include a link to your Steam profile!  Anyone that does not will be automatically excluded from the giveaway.  Regardless, so far I've gotten a wonderful response from the community.  You guys sure do put out!

__________________________________________________________________________________

**Winning edit**:  Hello everyone!  Thank you all for your enthusiasm.  After much internal deliberation and conflict, I have decided to select, (drum roll please)...Ross9795.  Firstly, your rap was delightful and certainly made me giggle.  Secondly, you aren't loaded with games.  Thirdly, my name is Russ so your name is pretty close too and that counts for something.

So there we have it folks.  This giveaway has sadly come to an end but we likely have a giveaway of Bioshock 2 in the near future.  Hope everyone at least had fun being creative.  I certainly enjoyed reading the posts!  Ich wuensche alle sich eine schoene nacht!  Aufwiedersehen."
3064,"My group doesn't seem to see much point in trying to get a hold of the books and instead we're simply trying to play with the SRD.

I can see huge advantages of the SRD over the physical books (Cross-references, not having to lug books around, errata, etc), but is there anything we're missing out on by skipping the book versions? I'd still love to get a copy of the books sometime, but I just thought I'd ask if there's any real advantage in content with using the SRD instead of the actual books or PDFs.

That said, I'd still like to throw some money towards Paizo since we've been using so much of the game for free. What other products would be recommended/which print versions are superior to the SRD if any?"

3070,"Well, here is my theory.

What if, they are receiving our messages? The messages we send them hoping for a reply, that type. Yes, I'm talking about extraterrestrial beings.

Well, as /u/fiddlerblue stated, the videos are basically extremely zoomed images of stars with distorted voices. What if, these grainy voices are what they received from what is left from our messages? Well it is possible since we've sent back many messages, including pixel art, 100,000 twitter messages of celebrity videos, etc. We've probably sent much more but that is out of my knowledge. What if those coloured dots were the pixel art if we sent? Well it is still in the probability zone. 

Anyways, ending  with another theory, the symbol always used for videos is Sagittarius. The signals which were received from the wow! signal were from Messier 55, which is from the same constellation, Sagittarius. Is it possible that these are replies from extraterrestrial beings? Or is it extraterrestrial beings relaying what we sent them in ciphers? Are they sending us back their coordinates, I.e where there are living beings?

I kept telling her she should because she's doing incredibly well.
But she wouldn't.
So I am.


She doesn't think what she's done is that impressive, but I do.
So I wanted to get some other opinions on this.

In just over a year she's lost 34 lbs, and now she's training for a half marathon.
She now weighs 120 lbs.

Further to that, in just over a year, thanks to her I've lost 45 lbs.
I now weigh ~148 lbs, and I'm starting to work up to running a 10k.

So how did we do it?

Well, exercise and portion control, eating a sensible amount of food made a huge difference.
Epecially rice and pasta.
She also got me into running, which is something I'd never done before.

3104,"It's kind of poor taste to be a braggart in real life so that leaves reddit as a place where I can beam. :D

I just turned 30 and finally reached my goal of 100,000 dollars of net assets. I came from an immigrant family and am from a working class neighborhood. My mother never went beyond 6th grade and my father only graduated high school. They are the ""save the cash under the mattress"" types. I had to practice discipline and learn how to save through my own experience.  

It feels great that I can take care of myself and not be a burden on anyone. Looking to the future, with continued savings, I will even be able to help my parents out in their old age.  

I want to thank you guys in this subreddit for helping me along and I would like to give a big shout out to the miracle of compounding interest! "
3105,"I was wondering if there was any SciFi out there where all learning had been found, and it was underwhelming. Where there was nothing much left to learn or discover past what we know already about Physics and the universe, where we as a species have found that FTL isn't possible, there aren't aliens, and were left alone and without purpose to strive for more, exploring the effect that would have, is there anything like that out there that explores those themes?"
3106,[deleted]
3107,"For me, it has to be psychology. Although it didn't began as a willing interest - I was sort of pushed into it by monotonous circumstances e.g. high school. Day after day of forcing myself to sponge up information for exams drove me to look for an alternative interest in the school environment to give meaning to the tasking gossip, grade related prejudice and 'helpful' teachers. I started studying my classmates and reading up on the subject during my spare time. It has become so entwined with natural stimuli that I find myself applying almost everything to an aspect of psychology - it simply fascinates me.

What's your calling Reddit?"
3108,"I bought a Schecter Hellraiser C8 about ten or twelve days ago, and it's my first extended range guitar. I'm enjoying it a lot, but I keep hearing things about Carvin and how good they are. I'm wondering if I should return the Schecter and order a Carvin.

I paid about $550 for the Schecter before tax, and the Carvin I'm looking at building is going to be about $1500 before tax. That's about $1000 that I wasn't planning on spending, but I could finagle it if it's worth it. I'd rather get one guitar now that's going to keep me happy for the foreseeable future than get a guitar that I'm going to want to upgrade in a couple of years anyway.

A bit of background: I haven't been playing the guitar very long, but I've been involved in music for over a decade. I listen to metal, but I listen to blues and jazz as well; pretty much everything except for country is fair game (and that's mainly because I can't stand typical country ""twang"" vocals). I'm not a professional player and I don't anticipate becoming a person who relies on his music for a living; it's more of a hobby for me and a way to socialize with people.

So here's my TL;DR question: How does Carvin compare to Schecter in a direct, one-to-one comparison, and how does the value-to-cost equation stack up for a casual musician?

* I am 208 lbs down from my starting weight.  This number staggers and humbles me, and also embarasses me that I still have so far to go.
* From April-November of last year, I walked 1000 miles.  This taught me that progress can be achieved if you stick with it, and also that physical activity is no substitute for a good diet. (Still couldn't cheat without paying for it on the scale)
*  I am training for a 50k hike in April and have just reached my upper training distance of 25 miles.  I will probably walk a marathon in the coming weeks just to say I did.  
* This evening I started running home and figured I would soon slow to a walk like usual. Nope!  Ran a 5k distance home without stopping. I've had a mental block about running so this is kind of a big deal.

3132,"OK, so it's now 37 years sober and the first thing anyone asks, that is if they're at all interested, is ""how did you do it?""

The simple answer would be that I didn't, but my Higher Power did.

A less simple answer would be that I was lucky enough to realize I wasn't as smart as I thought I was and so I did what AA in its collective wisdom told me to do.

So what was the trigger? To this day I don't honestly know. I had been hospitalized twice with DTs and was given up for dead or at least near-dead once. But, hey, I'm an alcoholic so I did what alcoholics do when they get out of the hospital -- I drank just like I always did, about a fifth of cheap vodka a day.

Then, drunk as a skunk on Valentine's Day I jumped into the car with my wife and headed across a snowy Wyoming Valley to the local detox center. No, not some expensive rehab center, but a dirty, grungy stop-of-last-resort for the area's drunks.

My wife was appalled at the treatment I got, enough so that she was launched into a near-20-year career in the drug and alcohol field. I do know they took my shoes away, all the while telling me I was free to leave anytime. Yes, sure, with 4"" of snow on the ground on the side of a mountain. Most of my detox stay remains a blur. I do know I was sick and miserable and slept a lot.

Then, on the last day -- by this time I'd earned a pair of corduroy slippers -- I went to my first AA meeting. It was mandatory, by the way. Not much registered except that the key to sobriety was 90 meetings in 90 days. I also picked up the nugget that my only job was to stay sober.

Not being a particularly religious sort I wasn't really into the spiritual aspects of the program, but deep inside I knew that something outside of myself was keeping me sober. So, OK, let's call it my Higher Power, whatever it might be.

They told me I'd probably lose my drinking buddies. They were right, I did, but it really wasn't a great loss. I had this enduring and unrealistic fear that if I went into a bar someone from AA would see me and I'd get my ass kicked. So I didn't.

Years go by. By the time I had 12 years sober I reasoned that I'd maybe gotten a little walking-around sense that could be of use to AA, which by then I realized had saved my life. So I did all the service jobs, and I mean almost all. I never became the District Chairman, but I came close.

Meetings every week became the norm. They kept telling me that maybe I didn't need a meeting every week, but it was good insurance. That was enough for me.

By 30 years it became apparent that I'd finally found a new way of life and alcohol wasn't a part of it. I was firmly convinced that I was like a black man -- I could change the status, but I was still black, only in my case the word isn't black, it's alcoholic.

Where to now at 37 years? I realize I have more years behind me than ahead of me -- life is like that. I'm still wedded to the alcoholic community -- bought tires today from a guy who'se an alcoholic. Why? Because unlike most tire salesmen, I knew he was honest. Guess that's a fringe benefit.

Why am I posting this wall of text?

Not for self aggrandizement, I assure you. Maybe it's to show newcomers or mid-termers that long term sobriety is quite do-able even though the first steps seem insanely difficult. I figure if just one person decides to challenge me and stay sober for 37 years and one day it will have been a worthwhile exercise. Especially since one day -- today -- is all we really have.

Thanks for reading.

Edit 2:  Since I'm seeing a lot of people not following the rules, here they are again.  Do not enter unless you have 50 comment karma and your account is at least 30 days old.  If you enter when you do not meet those requirements, you will not be added to the spreadsheet.  Only enter after you meet those minimum requirements since I will not be going through and checking to make sure your meet the requirements before the contest ends, only at the time of entry.  And like said before, if you do not include your country at the time of submission, you will not be added to the contest.

Edit 3:  Please do not put abbreviations for the country.  Unless your country is referred to by it's abbreviation in common parlance (USA, UK, UAE, etc), do not put it.  Not everyone knows the shorthand for your country and I won't go searching to figure out what country it is."

When it comes to me, I always emotionless and silent. Even with the closest friends I barely talk and even if I'm in a good mood inside, I can't show it from the outside. I can be in a really good mood and laugh loudly when I'm completely alone, but I can't feel the same when I'm around people. 
People always ask if something happened to me or am I sick, and I'm tired of answering that I always like that. Friends already used to my behavior and don't notice it, but I want to hang out with new people and faking my emotions looks too obvious.

3185,"Since January of this year been cutting back on Calories (about 1200 aday) and carbs (20-30 a day) and things have really started to progress. Bought a scale January 7th and weighed in at 321, as of this morning I am 294. First time I have been under 300 in probably 4 years. Other heavies might relate that when you know you are over weight by that much your don't want a scale to give you the painful conformation. Anyways just a comparison photo of the progress I have been making. Every week I have [sv] and [nsv] and it feels pretty damn good.

3189,"I'm very new to couchsurfing, having only surfed for one night. That went great for me, but it seems like the more I read this subreddit (and other travel forums discussing couchsurfing), I'm met with overwhelming negativity towards the state of the project today. Common points of dissatisfaction seem to be the usability of the website, the apparent large influx of ""noobie"" posts in regional groups, and how the community just isn't what it used to be. 

So what's the deal? Has couchsurfing simply grown too large for it's own good? Have the people behind the website lost their vision? I'm currently planing on embarking on a trip in a week or so on which I hoped to make liberal use of couchsurfing, but the more I read, the less viable this sounds. So, I guess my main question is: from the perspective of me, 19 year old guy looking to meet cool people while saving on accommodation costs, is couchsurfing the best way to go about it? I've heard of websites such as bewelcome, but they seem to  seriously lack distribution. 

I don't know, maybe I'm just letting nostalgic ""back in the day"" type people get the best of me, but it really concerns me how much hate couchsurfing is getting these days. Please discuss."
3190,"Lately I've found that a lot of the really good/classic novels that I've read have all been quite depressing on the whole. 

And hey, I can understand that on the whole, a fantastic read is one that moves you, that compels you to question the way things are, even disconcerts you a bit. But it gets a bit tiresome after a while.

So I wanted to see if any redditors here had some recommendations for uplifting, positive and/or memorable books. 

ps: sorry if this has been done before- I'm still a bit new to reddit!"
3191,"and I got 3.25 miles into my run when I realized how stupid I was being. I was sick of pussying out and avoiding the cold (it's about 20 degrees out today), and I absolutely hate running inside. It's boring.

So, I went outside and ran 3.5 more miles, careful to tread mindfully and avoid any ice. I loved it! Not only was it not cold out AT ALL, I actually started to sweat, and was grinning from ear to ear the entire time. The only reason I stopped when I did was because I... erm... had to use the bathroom (I just switched to vegetarianism and am still adjusting).

I know for the seasoned runners, this probably sounds silly. I started C25K last June to lose weight. I'm about 100 pounds down now and NEVER thought I'd be a runner.

Anyway, I'm happy as hell. Have a good day, guys, and if you haven't run yet, get out there and go!"

3193,"Hey guys, I wanted to bring this topic to r/teenagers so that people could have my thoughts on death and life after death, and I also want to see other people's thoughts on it. 

First of all, I have some trouble sleeping sometimes due to thinking a lot. A couple of nights ago I started thinking a lot about death and what might happen to us. It now makes me nervous to think that someday I will just be gone, I wouldn't be active anymore as who I am.

Life after death is something I have thought about quite a lot. What do you think will actually happen? Do you believe in heaven or hell, or something similar to that? Will we reincarnate into something else? Or will nothing happen at all? I don't have actual thoughts on what will happen, but reincarnation is what I would choose if I was given the chance.

Let me know your thoughts, i'm really open minded."

In short, where's a good place to start her off? I'm thinking, maybe a guided walkthrough of building and flying a to-orbit-and-back mission, but I'm not sure if that's going to be too much for a first time up or not.

3221,"Hey!

So I've spent a lot of the last few weeks trying to find another great Sci-Fi or fantasy series to jump into. Honestly i wouldn't even lock it down to those two genre's im really interested in a lot of different things including Non Fiction, Mystery, Action, whatever. I love this sub and hopefully I can get some great recommendations. 

Here is what I've read and liked a ton:

Basically everything by Peter F. Hamilton, he is probably my favorite writer.

Way of Kings/Words of Radiance - Definitely my favorite fantasy books out there.

The Martian - Obvs

The Expanse by James S.A. Corey - Fantastic books

The King Killer Chronicles - Great series, stoked for the final book.

Song of Fire and Ice - Classics

The Dresden Files

I tried Wheel of Time and really didn't like it. I wanted to finish it cause of Sanderson, but couldnt make it that far.

I deeply enjoyed A Closed and Common Orbit and The Long Way To A Small Angry Planet because of their warmth, empathy and humanity, which I honestly don't think I have felt in my reading, at least for a very long time. Currently I'm going through the Hyperion series, full of planetary annihilation, multi-world holocaust and impaling people on 3 mile tall trees of pain and its like... what the hell am I doing with my life? 

The world is terrifying enough as it is right now. I want to see visions of what humanity could be. There must be other good optimistic sci fi out there. What do you suggest?

I guess its just really easy to sell the idea of intelligent murder bots, but honestly it's a little depressing that people have zero faith in benevolent AI. Even real people like Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking have come out and said that AI is one of the biggest dangers to the human race, which sounds like alarmist bullshit because really AI is a tool. Its only dangerous when it's misapplied by human beings.

3238,"In the Watchmen graphic novel series, Rorschach is not a traditional hero. He is uncompromising. He embodies many traits of absolutism and objectivism. Good and evil are clearly defined in his mind. Everything about him is starkly black and white. Now, how is this relevant to my theory? Rorschach is, thematically, a defined shape. What emotions, thoughts and feelings that can be evoked about him vary among readers of Watchmen. Some view his right-wing philosophies and lack of mercy as a weakness, other see him as a badass and an awesome character to be loved and beholded due to his uncompromising nature. Rorschach is an inkblot test: whatever you think and feel about him reveals truths about yourself. "
3239,"I'm currently writing a short-story and it's written in the first-person.  The problem is I want to insinuate the character died very shortly after the story ends, I mean minutes or seconds.  Does it cause the story to make no sense if there's no longer a character to tell the story or should I expect the to suspend disbelief at the ending?  Should I just switch to a third-person narrative?"

Lifestyle change begins 01/2012

I think there are few words that feel as ugly and awkward as the word obese. Its the kind of word that always follows a sympathetic pause in the presence of the paunchy. It is so round and clinical and weighted down with taciturn lowness that it clings to a person in a way that squeezes and cripples him with what is simultaneously the most formidable and and the most elementary malady for a person to beat. January 5, marked one year since I resolved to change myself.This essay will probably be the most gushing and candid thing I’ve ever written, parts of this may seem attention seeking or boastful but I promise that this comes from the deepest, most sincere, and thought-worn parts of my heart. Its something I’ve had kicking around in my head for the better part of 15 years; this is the eulogy for my obesity.

Size has always dominated me, I began to chub around the fourth grade. I wouldn’t say that I was by any means a too-sad kid but I do think that feeling sad was a trigger for me. As a kid I had a difficult time finding a place where I felt like I was supposed to be. Whenever I would venture a try at something new, I would inevitably leave inadequate. I would feel bitter about being rejected by girls or I would feel sad about not being able to keep up with boys. In response I withdrew and went to food. As I grew up, I never felt right and I never I had anything that was mine with which to excel…I would fantasize about accomplishment and taking ownership of the kind of charisma and strength that would enamour me to those girls and make myself a hero in the minds of those guys, but I had lost so much ground over time that the idea of changing anything was daunting. It felt like my life was looming over me and I used food and humor as a means to swat it.

Gaining weight was mostly gradual with a few sharp spikes. It went on slowly until one day I realized that I was a fat kid and at once the idea got stuck in my head. I remember this feeling of compliance like:""well, this is me now."" As I grew older and boundaries widened, I became heavier. I would ride my bike to the Meijer on Clyde Park when it had a McDonalds in it and I would eat a Double Quarter meal Super-Sized and a twenty-piece chicken nuggets, turn around and ride home. This secret meal would lay on top of everything else I eaten during the day and I would enjoy it with stealth in my mind. It didn’t help that I was also slow to develop socially; I didn't have friends yet and food became music for me. It entertained and occupied me. I would go to movies by myself (which I loved doing) I would devour my lonely popcorn and inhale my propitious Pepsi. With every little bit of freedom I enjoyed, my weight gain would apex and level off. When I got my first job (at a pizza joint) I had tons of free food and money to spend on whatever I liked, when I got my license I could travel farther for different brands and combinations of fast food. Every bit of independance further cemented my habits.

Eventually I did develop a bit of a social lean but I still had a hard time accepting myself to my peers, I always felt like my stature stood between us. For example, one year we went to Michigan Adventure, I hadn’t thought much about the seat in a roller coaster and and never had a problem with a lap bar, but then I got in line for The Corkscrew. We waited eagerly and when the time came I walked up to the cart and looked inside and I thought ""shit."" I sat down next to a friend and it was tight but we were both able to sit. I reach up to pull down the shoulder harness and it wouldn’t click. My chest is too far from my back to get the harness to lock. I want to get out but instead an employee comes to me and tries to help by pressing it into me while I 'suck it in' No dice. I stood up and walked away with all the eyes on my back. I held the ride up and I was that fat kid that didn’t fit so I watched my friends ride the coaster from the sidewalk. It was the first time my size made me feel t isolated in front of someone. My attitude was to quietly tack roller coasters on to a list of things I couldn’t do. Eventually I out grew movie theater seats, airplane seats, and ‘Big & Tall’ sections in the mall and I passively waved goodbye to all of them.

And time just passed by - I built powerful, lasting, and comfortable relationships. I worked and had fun but never really achieved anything. I had quiet goals but all of the things I wanted for myself came to be plain conversational fodder, things you get drunk and dream about out loud. Everything I wanted was so public and everything I was was so private. I wanted to act and I wanted to be a comedian. I did open mics and it left me disgusted and exposed, it was a sort of exhilarating misery that kept you facing the goals you pushed away. I gradually lost momentum and just sort of stalled. Life for a few years was like a room dimly lit by the flickering light of a TV. It was quiet, and private, and comfortable. I remained stealthily obsessed with food. It occupied my mind. The flavors and textures and that feeling of occupation in your core gave me a sense of contentment that was so durable that it became ever-present in my life.

I haven’t always lacked a sense of the need for change. Periodically, I would have manic bouts of conviction and backbone. I would face the world and strive to be social, and better, and healthy. I would purse comedy again, I joined gyms, I sought and gained relationships...complacency though eventually had me back in my room eroding from a habit bordering agoraphobia. Eventually I realized that I wasn’t the possessor friends I once was and I became aware of the cheerlessness I felt for myself and that revealed to me the delicacy of the relationships I had. I was pushing people away from me so that I could revel in my faults. I began to see the folly and futility of so many of the years behind me. I became morbidly mindful of my mortality; I would imagine a roommate finding me dead and how they would react. How my family would react. In that, I realized that I’d lived so absent mindedly for so long that I had become OK with being dead when I was 40 and had subconsciously planned to be alone and idle for whatever time I had left. I’d let indulgence and apathy become intuitive.

A dramatic shift in my mindset came to pass around summer 2011. It was also around this time that I, as none of my friends or family knew, auditioned for a weight loss reality show. On the show, overweight men and women are taken away to a fitness sanctuary where they are taught healthy habits and exercise and exercise and exercise ... it was much like a real-life adult version of the movie Heavyweights. While gone, participants don’t communicate with family or friends and then, after an agonizing and heart lifting episode is complete, they are revealed to friends and family in a new body and attitude. I wanted to be a part of that show and thought I had it. I was interviewed and inline to be a part of the show when, abruptly, the series was put on hold and the new season never materialized.

I was devastated. I had poured my future into this idea that I could be taken away and fixed. That I was going to leave and come back as a new person for everyone to hold up cheer for. I had built up tremendous optimism and lost it all just as quickly. I went right back onto the destructive beat I had just left. Looking back, not making it on that show broke something for me and pushed me to get bad enough that I could get better.

Fortunately it only took about six months, I grieved the loss of my spotlight and my champion transformative moment and during that time reflected soulfully about who I am to the people in my life, who I am to myself, and most importantly recognized that I have it in myself to become the kind of person I want to be: I want to constantly be aware of my potential. I want to be a man that knows and practices right from wrong. I want to modestly inspire goodness, optimism, and effort in people; I want my integrity and my character to be something worth holding up. I want to be external and in the lives of people and I want people to feel that having me in their lives is a thing of value. In order to realize these things I had to accept accountability for what had misrepresented my capability and demeaned my resolve for so long. It wasn’t my weight, it was my attitude about life and an enduring lack of enthusiasm for the future.

I took responsibility for my well being one year ago, I weighed 420 pounds, I wore a XXXXXL dress shirt and 48 jeans. My life and the way I lived it literally changed overnight and hasn’t stumbled. I began by eating a calorie restricted diet and eventually shifted to focus on lower carbohydrates. For exercise I started by walking three miles a day. I would take the bus to school, get off walk a ways and get back on further down the route. Once spring rolled around I began to bike. Those rides progressed from two, to six, to ten mile rides, mostly to and from school. Soon the distance between school and home wasn’t clear or long enough so riding became a purposeful thing rather than utility. I rode and rode. By the end of the summer I had joined the half century club having ridden over fifty miles in one ride. In August I began running using the Couch to 5k program and ran my first full 5k on November 17 and putted along to finish my first 10k on December 15. As of today I have lost 178 pounds, wear a large and 34 jeans. I am stronger and faster than I’ve ever felt myself be. I feel appreciation and optimism in everything that I do and I sense that this is the way life should feel. I’ve still got a lot of work to do but at this point the habits have rooted and the education that I’ve gained over the last year will nurture them. I cannot see my life going backwards, this is who I was always supposed to be.

I’ve spent most of my life planning and daydreaming without action and now everything seems so attainable.This is why I write today, I’m ready to say goodbye to that old life now and to focus on maintaining goal oriented momentum and pushing harder so that the strength in my musings becomes the strength in my character. I can do better, I can do better. I can be the Greatest Man in the World.

Thank you to Mom, my Dad, Jerry, My brothers Eric and Adam, Jessica, Marshall, Corey, Colby; you guys specifically have given me clarity and always been frank with be about delicate things. And to Britt, Allen, Jen, Margie, and Alex, you guys give me the happiness I need to suck it up and do it. This might all seem overly sentimental but I only plan on doing this once and you’ve changed my life in ways that can’t really make sense to you.

Part of the audition process for the reality show I mentioned was to create a series of videos focusing on different aspects of my life. I edited one of them and am keeping a few private, but as for the rest, I don’t see a reason to keep it closeted anymore, I feel like that person is gone now. I uploaded these in May 2011, until now it has been accessible only to the producers of the show. For those interested, I have the links listed below. I think they are a thought-provoking relic.

3265,"First, pic: http://i.imgur.com/BxKnFl.jpg

Stats: M 24 6'2"" 

Story: This past 4th of July I went to my friends pop's house to blow shit up and go swimming. The very next day I saw some pictures of me in my underoos swimming in the river and realized that I had lost control. So, that was July 5th, 2012. I had to shop around to find a scale that would weigh me, another eye opener, but finally found one. 389lbs. Sweet merciful baby Jesus. How had I let it come to this? That was it. Change or die. So I cleaned up my diet. Went with MFP and keep myself around 1500 cal/ day. Didn't really start working out until November. November 1st I quit smoking, and started C25k. Let me say, the program is amazing. My fat ass runs 3 miles every other day now, and I couldn't feel better. Today being January 5th is 6 months after when I started this journey, so I decided to break my every-other-week weigh in and hop on the scale this morning. 
288lbs. Glory glory hallelujah! Just over 100lbs shed in 6 months. I'd never have thought I was capable of this. 

If I can answer any questions for anyone please let me know, I'll do my best. I know I've got a long way to go, but as the song says, ""damn it feels good to be a gangster"". 

Note for the pics: the first one is of my at the offroad park with my Jeep getting down and dirty. The second is this morning before work, yeah, I know; dat 'stache. I did it for MOvember and decided to keep it. "
3266,"Will there even come a time in the distant future where all the land has eroded to a level below sea level, or where there is a few mountains but a majority of the earth is covered in water?"
3267,"Okay, so I have been a long time fan of the history of religions, and I am an ex Catholic. That being said, I was never, as a Catholic, particularly interested in the history of *my* religion. Perhaps it was because I already learned about Catholicism in school daily. Perhaps it was because something deeper in me didn't want to know how ridiculous it sounded, or already knew. Perhaps it was because Catholicism bored the shit out of me. Regardless, I had never done my research. 

Well, after spending more and more time on this sub, I have repeatedly seen brief arguments about whether or not Jesus was real, but *always* with the majority seeming to agree that there was no contemporary evidence. I was baffled, quite honestly. I had always heard and read that Jesus, Yeshua, Joshua, whether or not he was divine, was a *real proven* historical figure. So, I collected information from those I knew to believe Jesus was a live person (my brother, his priest, an old history teacher, and a friend who is a devout Christian) and gathered some sources as to who they believed provided evidence for the life of Jesus as a man. The list *started* as quite long, but I crossed off a great deal of names in the first 3 minutes by simply reading the life span that they lived, and seeing that it did not at all reconcile with the life of Jesus. The *closest* I got to any evidence was a brief bit from the Romans that was *totally unverifiable* as a primary source, and something about Virgil, who according to many wrote about Jesus as a current events issue, only to find out Virgil merely *predicted* the birth of a messiah, soon to come, and was actually *dead* before Jesus began his life's work as a missionary. Well so much for that shit!

Next up, I am going to read the book *The Historical Jesus* (Ed. by Gaalya Cornfeld) because that's what I've got around the house to read. 

Seriously, this has changed a lot of things for me. I had pretty much always thought that Christianity was unbelievable, but it means something totally different to find out that they may or may not be basing the religion off of a person who *never even existed*.

3275,"I have been seriously trying to lose weight for almost a full year now. I'm female, 5'8, 180-185 lbs. I have worked with 2 different trainers roughly 2-3 times a week and I participate in spin classes and do my own spin workouts outside of my training sessions.

I have not lost a single pound on the scale. In fact, my lack of weight loss was so confusing that my trainer sent me to the doctor, where I found out that I am insulin resistant. This means when I overeat carbs, I gain a ton of weight overnight in water weight. It also makes losing weight difficult. I got so discouraged with the scale, I stopped weighing myself. We began taking Body Fat measurements to track my progress instead...and I'm down a whole 5%! That may not sound like a lot for a year, but for me, its awesome!

I'm in the best shape of my life, but also at my heaviest weight. (Ironic, no?). So, to reiterate what this sub always says, the scale is NOT always a great indicator of health or progress. :) "
3276,"So a couple of years ago whenever I noticed how many members of my family were being diagnosed with health issues (namely diabetes) I decided it was time to get serious about losing weight. The first thing I did was start limiting the number of white carbs and sugars that I consumed, replacing them with more whole grains, fruits, veggies, and protein. I'm a vegetarian so this was actually fairly difficult as my diet had always revolved around pasta and rice. I allowed myself a cheat dinner and cheat dessert every weekend, and also photographed everything I ate to hold myself accountable.

The second thing I did was enroll in a local boot camp, three days a week. I knew that if I was going to lose weight that I wanted to be getting stronger underneath the flubbery jiggly mess. 

Between these two things the first 40 or so pounds pretty much melted away within half a year or so. It took me over a year to lose the next 20 pounds to get me where I am now. During that time I hit a plateau and after some gentle coercing from my boyfriend (who by the way has also lost over 50lbs), I started counting calories with myfitnesspal. It helped get me over the bump.

My cheat meal/dessert has now turned into an increased calorie limit on the weekends, but the idea is still there. I really don't view myself as being on a diet; I see all of this as a permanent lifestyle change. I love cooking and don't want to feel deprived at each meal. Honestly I get a little depressed when I'm browsing the MFP forums and I see the bizarre, low-calorie and flavorless creations that so many dieters survive on, haha. That's definitely not the lifestyle for me and I hope to show people that you can lose weight and be healthy on something more than rabbit food. 

Anyway, everyone comes to these threads for the pics right? :) I made a little imgur album with a selection of before and after photos riiiight here: http://imgur.com/a/753TR

3278,"35 days sober today and feeling pretty good. Just wanted to share something I was thinking about.

Drinking for me often resulted in unexpected consequences. In hindsight I guess none of the consequences should have been fully unexpected, but I was blinded by poison and so they always felt unexpected the next day. Maybe it was a $200 bar tab on my credit card. Oops. How about damaging a relationship. Whatever, forgive and forget right? Maybe I'd do something or say something embarrassing. Who hasn't anyway? Maybe I'd black out and wake up on the floor of my bedroom (how the hell did I get home?), and, ouch, there's some cuts and bruises I didn't really need. But seriously, they heal, and I wear pants and long sleeves to work anyway so big deal right? The point is, every time I drank it was like spinning the roulette wheel of unexpected consequences. Finally though, I got the blinders off and recognized the pattern.

Now that I've been sober, I'm starting to experience a completely new set of unexpected consequences. Something here, something there. My motivation to do constructive things has been improving greatly. I've had a slight anger problem since I was a teenager and though it's never been detrimental, it's something I can gladly do without. Improved motivation has encouraged me to take the necessary steps to understanding my anger and keeping it in check. My relationship with my S/O (never bad to begin with) has gotten even better. My sleep has improved. I feel more confident. My anxiety is way down. The future excites me more. I am encouraged to try new things. Life is just... better.

I quit drinking because I was scared as hell. I was scared for my health, I was scared of where I was headed, I was scared of unexpected consequences. Now that I've been sober 35 days I can actually look forward to unexpected consequence. I hope all of you in the early stages like me are experiencing the same thing.

Keep up the good work!"

3287,"This week has been interesting, to say the least. It all started on Monday, when I saw [a YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABgL2LcoBTU) posted on /r/getmotivated about some guy who approaches a beautiful girl in a store and simply asks ""Are you single?"" The girl's positive reaction served as an inspiration for me, and I decided to try it in real life. 

Tuesday I went to a clothes shop at the local mall to buy a jacket. As I walk in there with confidence and a smile upon my face, the girl in there says ""You look like you know what you want,"" with a smile on her face. ""Yes, I do,"" I said. I told her I wanted a jacket and she started showing me jackets. Taking a deep breath I then asked her casually ""Are you single?"" while looking at her with a smile.

She starts giggling, before she tells me (exact quote): ""I do have a boyfriend, but I wish I wasn't in a relationship."" She continued to look at me. - ""What about you? Do you have a girlfriend?""

""Y-no,"" I answered. For some reason I was about to say 'yes' to that question, but quickly changed it to 'no'. That got her intrigued.

""That was an interesting answer,"" she said. I said something about that I used to be in a long relationship, but not anymore (a lie; that relationship ended years ago). Then we spent some time trying jackets, keeping a friendly conversation. I bought a jacket at a bargain price, along with some socks, which I playfully dropped down on the counter next to her. That made her giggle. 

When I left the store, her male colleague gave me thumbs up while she looked the other way.

Today (Friday) I was on a supermarket at the same mall, shopping beer and groceries for the weekend. As I stand in line to the cashiers, I see this beautiful, young brunette with ice-blue eyes sitting behind my cashier. I load my groceries onto the conveyor belt and patiently wait for my turn. She greets me, I greet her. She scans my groceries. She tells me how much it is. 

""I'll use my card,"" I say and swipe my card. Then I ask her confidently (but casually): ""Are you single?"" I smile to her. 

""What?"" she asks, looking at me in something looking like disbelief. 

""Are you single?"" I repeat with the same confidence. 

""Yeah..."" she asks with a smile and a downward gaze, charmingly geeky, almost guffawing, even twisting a little bit in her chair. 

""You wanna go on a date with me?"" I ask her. She looks at me with that same guffawing demeanor. 

""I work so much, almost every day,"" she replies, her voice thickening a bit as if she's about to start giggling (or groaning). 

""We'll take each day as it comes,"" I answer cool and casual. - ""Have a nice day, A[...]."" Her name tag is fully visible on the left side of her chest. 

""You too,"" she says. I pack my groceries, bid her goodbye and leave the store with a big smile on my face. 

**At the very same day**, when I enter the gym, I see the blond, gorgeous woman behind the counter which I've fancied for some time. I say hello to her, she says hello back with her beautiful smile. I swipe my member's card, before turning to her with a serious look: 

""Listen, S[...], I need to ask you a question."" She is all ears. - ""Are you single?"" 

A big smile appear on her face. 

""I'm afraid I'm not."" I smile back at her. - ""Sorry, no. I'm not."" 

""I felt I had to simply ask you,"" I replied. She totally agreed, still with a big smile on her face. 

Then we switched over to a completely normal conversation with her being very helpful and I being completely cool and casual. I don't think the smile disappears from her face at all. She wishes me a good work-out, and I wish her a pleasant day, before I go and change. 

**Less than an hour later** I approach this young, stunning brunette with beautiful hazel eyes. I've noticed that she sent me some looks while I worked out. 

""Hi,"" I say with a smile. She turns to me, almost as if startled. 

""Oh, hi,"" she says. 

""Are you okay?"" I ask. 

""Yeah, I'm fine,"" she says. Her voice is tender, and she has a kind and quiet demeanor. 

""You were over at the treadmill, weren't you?"" I ask her. She says 'yes'. - ""Are you single?"" I feel my heart racing as I look into her eyes. She giggles: 

""No, I'm not."" 

""You kept looking at me from over there,"" I said with a smile. 

""Oh, I'm sorry!"" she exclaims in a most humble manner. She's actually blushing! 

""No, no, it's okay,"" I say with a soothing voice. - ""It's very nice that you have a boyfriend."" She smiles at me with her kind eyes. - ""Have a nice work-out."" 

""Thank you,"" she says, smiling. 

I leave her with a big grin on my face, walking like I don't have a care in the world. Four approaches in four days. Three approaches in one single afternoon. A skilled pick-up artist couldn't have done it better. Although I got three nos and one 'maybe', my chance would have been zero if I hadn't approached at all. 

**Tl;dr: Confronted my fears and approached four girls in four days, three of those in one afternoon. Got three nos and one 'maybe'.**"
3288,"The thrilling conclusion to Mio's route. They managed to compress a lot of story in this one, so it felt rushed. The final, highly abstract scene was a bit more Gainax-esque in animation than I imagined it would be from the game. I must admit when they started playing the song Haruka Kanata, I was moved. Definitely my favorite episode overall.

Next episode looks like...well I won't spoil what it's about, but I'm pretty excited to be introduced to best girl."

3292,"It is Sunday, 9:30am in Bismark, North Dakota.  It is time to stop squatting for a minute, set down that barbell, and  think about what the best thing you did for your fitness this week was: your fitness Victory.

Maybe you're 6 weeks into the rest of your life, where fitness is a new priority for you, and you just got used to shopping properly to make sure you're fed properly to make sure you stay fit.  Perfectly respectable victory.  Maybe you completed your peak week, and competed in a bodybuilding show.  Perhaps you lifted more weight on your back than you ever have before, and you kind of can't believe it, because you really didn't believe it was possible just a few weeks ago when everyone was telling you to just keep eating more, sleeping, and following the program and you would, and then you did.   Perhaps you ran like a mofo through minor ankle pain and subzero temperatures, keeping your eye on the prize, just keeping on running.  If so: **we want to hear about it.**



Here are last week's **Top five fitness Victories:** 

* **poagurt (101 points)** [Finally hit a 550 lb / 250kg deadlift at 163 lbs body-weight yesterday.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qpe7b-lx-fQ). This was my goal for my powerlifting meet in April, so to be able to pull this a little under three months out from competition is huge.

* **disiple_of_iron (80 points)** I squatted 550 for 5 reps. I also went to my first party on campus and I had like 10 different guys come up to me and tell me they'd seen me in the gym and were  impressed.

* **Ippy_nutsmasher (40 points)** I hit a 230lb OHP on Friday, despite fucking up my knee doing front squat fuckery.

* **super_luminal (29 points)** Hit [200 lb x 4 deadlifts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMIwPJNu55Y) at 127 lb bw one week out from my next Bikini competition, when I'm weak, hungry, and exhausted from going to the gym twice a day every day but Sunday.  (Yeah, I know they're ugly, see exhaustion/starvation above)

* **kluged (26 points)** Passed out after finishing my last set of deads. Woke up to high fives.


**The ""You're Awesome"" Spotlight.**
 
This week, the spotlight shines SaneesvaraSFW, who did a 1.5x bodyweight anderson squat [with video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTx7v-iCwNI).  Doing 245lbs from the hole is a great feat, and a lot of work went into getting to that point, which makes it more than deserved to say: **SaneesvaraSFW, You're Awesome!**
 

The ""You're Awesome"" spotlight is an occasional feature of Victory Sundays, wherein I select a deserving recipient to receive the eponymous adulation, in celebration of their previous Sunday's Victory. If you want to nominate someone for the ""You're Awesome"" spotlight, simply respond to their post with ""You're Awesome!""

220lbs in the first picture, and the second was taken about six months later (170lbs maybe? 165?). The last picture was about two weeks ago (a year after the second pic), at 150lbs. I'm frustrated with my progress between the second two pictures, considering the difference is so much bigger between the first two and the length of time shorter, but I know it gets harder to lose as you lose more. Besides, I've been doing a lot more strength training in the past couple months, and I think it shows. Trying to stay positive! Tips about losing those last stubborn pounds are welcomed. "

Anyway the steroids caused me to swell up and retain water, it also made me very hungry. Since i was in the hospital every winter until i was about 9, my eating habits in the hospital caused my stomach to stretch and the steroids cause me to retain water for a long period of time. So i eventually developed bad eating habits, anyway going into my junior year of highschool a  tornado hit our town, and that summer after being rejected the year prior by a girl i liked and my dad and grandpa telling me i needed to lose weight( i was about 5'9"" and 225 lbs. at my worst). I decided to go on a diet, it was not easy but about 6 months later i was over 50 lbs. lighter and (weighing me in at about 164 lbs.) i feel better than ever and i finally got the girl who had rejected me at first to be my girlfriend."

I get that it's not a big a deal as some of you guys who've lost half of your body weight on keto, but damn it's nice to see results. And remember, this is only after a month of keto. This diet really is all that!

3331,"When she first handed me a Septim, I had no idea who she was. In fact, I couldn't even see her face. The first things I saw were her blades. They were black with red veins and the glowed purple and red. Her armor was made of white sloping plates and her head was covered with an ancient black hood, complete with an obsidian mask!
As the warm coin was placed in my palm, the cold black face made me flinch back and almost fall off the bench. I recovered, and repeated the Beggar's Praye just as Brenuin taught me.
""Oh! Thank you... Divines bless your warm soul!""
The lady, noticing  my shock pulled off the mask and it vanished into thin air. To my surprise, my new hero was an Orc woman. She was actually quite pretty, with only two small canines jutting up when she smiled. Her hair was pulled back and her skin was almost more bronze than green.
""It actually goes, 'bless your kind heart'. My cousin taught it to me when I was about your age. Now, what's your name?"" she said in a soft, warm voice.
""Lucia,"" I stammered in awe. THIS lady was an orphan like me?! I couldn't believe it!
""That's a beautiful name! Mine is Mauni-Ka,"" she sat down next to me, ""Now, if you don't mind me asking, why are you out here begging?""
My eyes began to water right away. ""It's... It's what Brenuin said I should do. He's the only one that's been nice to me since... since Mama..."" At that, my inner strength left me and I began to cry tears that I thought had drained away weeks ago. For the first time, however, I felt arms wrap around me and pull me close. After I was able to pull myself back together, I continued my story. ""Anyways, my Aunt and Uncle took over our farm and threw me out. Said I wasn't good for anything, so I wound up here. But... I... I don't know what to do! I miss her so much..."" I looked up, and saw a tear streaking Mauni-Ka's face.
""There there, little one. Don't cry! I know what it's like to feel lonely... Lately, that's seemed to be all I know,"" with that, she stood up and reached out her hand, ""But how about we fix that?""
I stared at her, dumbfounded. ""You mean... you want to adopt me?""
She smiled wide, ""If you want! I have this big house north of Falkreath, and Aela gets bored with only a Bard to keep her company! Plus, a child should never have to sleep behind an inn. So, what do you say... daughter?""
As I leapt into my new mother's arms, I saw a side of her that nobody on Nirn had ever seen. That vulnerability, that warmness as she held me close, made me wonder who adopted whom. But from then on, neither of us was ever alone again."

3334,"I'm a debuting biotechnology researcher. I find that genetic engineering could be a really good thing for humanity. I think genetically modified organism are one of the most graceful technology we have : between let's say a robotic minidrone or a programmed fly used to do the same thing, I prefer the technology that runs on sugar and is biodegradable than the one which needs us to dig mines and poison the rivers. I see it as what TV Tropes calls ""[sufficiently advanced bamboo technology](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedBambooTechnology)""

Yet biotechnologies are almost unanimously described as inherently bad. Playing God and almost always triggering horrible death or mutations. That's another thing yet, every thing biology related is comically misunderstood. The most recognized image is growing new limbs, which is just plain moronic. I mean, scifi has a lot of example of hard scifi where physics is obviously understood by the authors, yet I have not seen the same for biology.

Anyway, rant's over, do you guys know about any (preferably hard) scifi work in which biotechnologies are not just synonymous to creating Cronenberg abominations."

3336,This post is many months late I don't know why I did not post this a long time ago when I had the idea but I think it would be nice if our home planet would be different from the preferd planet type. When I saw the preset mollusk empire with the tentacle arms that they used to swing from the trees but then their planet turned desert I thought of this. Wouldn't it make more sense for their preferred planet to be jungle however they have adapted to live on their desert homeworld.

3344,"Hey all! I forgot to post on my 6 month ketoversary a few days ago so this kind of goes for that too! On Saturday, I did the Color Run in Jacksonville, FL with my friend and our two 6 year old daughters. The Color Run is a true 5k fun run, you don't have to run at all and it isn't timed. I planned on walking the whole thing but my friend is a runner, and we just sort of started out running it. We made it 2k in before I had to stop to walk some, and then we continued running off an on for the rest of it, as much as I could cajole my daughter to shake off her case of the lazy-legs.

As I was looking at the pics after, I realized that she weighs 55 pounds, so it was a spiffy ""look at me holding my lost weight"" pic.

I know a lot of us want June to give birth in the woods and somehow make it out to Canada. I think this is highly improbably considering how much help she had with her last attempt, and yet it was a failed attempt. 

But can you imagine how pissed Serena will be if June gives birth in the woods and then is found and brought back? Serena will have missed that heinous ceremony where she’s surrounded by Wives telling her how much she deserves this while rubbing her feet and coaching her on breathing through fake labor. Women in Gilead are *only* good for childbirth, and she won’t even have the satisfaction of pretending with all the other Wives. She’ll just be handed June’s baby with none of the acknowledgment. I wonder if she’ll realize, finally, that she is not the mother and never will be. If this even happens. 

I sort of hope this happens. And *then* I hope June escapes.

3370,"Hi ladies =) Next weekend is my baby shower, and despite being told that I needn't do anything and that my mom and sister-in-law would do it all so I could relax, I convinced my mom to let me help with the food (because I'm pretty experienced with doing food for parties and I'm a bit of a control freak).

We are expecting about 30 people, and are doing a Dr. Seuss theme (which is also the theme of the nursery). At first she was trying to get me to go with a full on Dr. Seuss theme for all the food, but after looking for ideas, I didn't think there would be enough variety and it felt kind of forced. So we're going with a Dr. Seuss cake, and then a bunch of other food.

My sister-in-law and her mom are bringing a couple of dips, but I'm kind of drawing a blank when it comes to what else to make, since I'm not sure how many different options we should offer (I've never planned a party this size before). We're having a casual afternoon couples shower, and planning mostly appetizer-type food. 

How many different options should we have and about how much of each? I've been thinking about doing deviled eggs, I always have a fruit salad and a veggie platter, and I have about a million ideas but just not sure which way to go. Any tips would be greatly appreciated!"

3376,"Its been since high school (12 years) since I've written anything for my own satisfaction. I want to start again, not to try and write a best selling novel or gain any sort of recognition for it, but simply because there is something inside of me trying to get out. I keep getting urges to write, but when I sit down to do it...nothing comes out.

Does anyone have any suggestions for shaking off the rust? Its been so long that I can't really remember how to let things flow out of me anymore. I don't think its writers block since I think you have to actually have written recently in order to call it writers block. Anyone been here before?

Recently decided to learn Van Halen's Beat It solo and now I'm obsessed with playing this solo over and over again. It's like 30 seconds of bliss for me and sometimes I'll play it like 50 times in a day. It's gotten so bad that my SO has asked me to wear headphones cause she can't get the song out of her head. 

Before the Beat It solo, I was obsessed with Slash's Sweet Child O Mine. 

So anyone addicted to playing a certain guitar solo like I am?

3380,"In my world, the races came about from how the earliest people adapted to their environment and what they ate. The Murrough settled the shores, and ate fish, and so they adapted to be amphibious. Burls lived in a harsh cold environment fighting giants and large creatures which they ate, and so they became great in size and strength. Humans settled in the fields, farming, building civilizations, eating crops and cattle. And so they have a natural affinity for civilization, farming, and animal husbandry. Humans are famous (or infamous) among the other races, specifically the longer living ones, for their constant economics expansion, scheming, and art.

Now tell me about yours."
3381,"I was on my bicycle and just happened to pick that night to forget my helmet. I ended up being hit so hard, I was propelled 12 feet into the air (according to witnesses), hit the windshield hard enough to spider it, and the I landed on the ground. It all happened rather fast and all I remember is 'being hit'. Everything else was told to me by witnesses and the first responders. Anyways... 

I ended up with a broken tibia. It required surgery to put screws in my ankle to hold it in place. It was displaced by 3mm. My head and neck are fine. Aside from my right ankle, so is the rest of my body, aside from a few road rashes.

The reason I'm posting this is because various people, including, but not limited to:

- my mother
- a handful of aunts and uncles
- random orderlies and nurses at the hospital I was in

are claiming that this was that an act of 'god' and I have been told at least once:

- God is watching over me
- I have a guardian angel watching over me
- God is good

I've already told my mother to shut up and spare me her religious babble. She knows my opinion of her and her beliefs and knows quite well that I don't share her beliefs at all. I've given everyone else a break, but if this continues with my non-immediate family, there's going to be a stern talking to in the near future.

Thought I'd post this here to brag a little bit about how I can take a hit (this isn't the first time I've been hit by a car while on a bicycle -- it's my third time, but it's the first time I've ever broken anything in my life) and to see if anyone has suggestions on how to deal with this politely, but while being clear and direct about how rude what is being said is.

PROTIP: If you roll with a fall and not tense up, it greatly decreases the potential of any serious injuries along with the severity of any serious injuries that end up resulting. Any experienced DJ or downhill biker can tell you this. This was no act of god, it was years of experience and knowing how react to a sudden accident like this.

3382,"Compared to when you are single, how does a good relationship feel like, other than feeling less lonely and having sex? Being in any relationship will imply decrease in loneliness and having sex, so how do you know whether a relationship is good for you?

I am assuming both people are good people, there is no abuse or cheating involved. Suppose they start dating each other and treat each other well. How do they know they are good for each other?

I am a woman, and I posted this to /r/AskReddit, but that was probably not the correct place, and /r/relationships requires you to ask questions about specific relationships, not general ones, so I decided to post here.

This might sound like a stupid question, but it is a serious issue for me. I can't recognize a good relationship when I see it. I don't get out of a relationship until a major fight occurs, surely most people can sense a relationship isn't going well before it gets ugly? People who saw me with my previous partner and said we didn't seem ""together"" though they saw us everywhere together. Whatever that means."

We don't have any problems with her except one. . . She chews up everything. We started locking her downstairs at night where there's nothing really for her to get to but she still finds a way. She has chewed up tablecloths, printer paper, rugs, christmas bags, and pretty much everything except for furniture. Her favorite thing to do is get in our trash. Despite having a can with a lid and putting gates up in the doorways she still manages to get to it. Today she ripped the metal gate off the wall and got trash everywhere. 

We've tried everything to get her to stop this. We've scolded her, isolated her (time out), used water/vinegar spray, even tried locking her in a cage at night (she chewed up the cage door). Nothing is working. We can't afford obedience school so we're looking for a solution that will help us keep her from chewing things/her getting in the trash."

3404,"First of all, thank you everyone here!

I am a 20 year old male, 6'0"" and am currently 150 pounds. It took roughly 7 months of strict calorie counting to get here but it was well worth it. 

In terms of what I did it wasn't much. Very little formal exercise with the exception of a bit of running here and there. I also worked outside during the summer so that really helped. 


I tried my hardest to stay within my caloric bounds but every few weeks I would allow a day where I wouldn't care about how many calories I would have. It probably slowed me down a bit but it was well needed to keep me sane. I also tried to stay away from breads and pastas but I didn't make it a point. If I wanted some toast I would have some so it was not a strict keto diet. 

I have managed to maintain ~150 for a few weeks now and I feel great! 

Anyways, here are some pictures of my progress!

pardon the circlejerking question, but I was wondering if anyone has any recommendations of films that capture the essence of the '80's like ""Drive"" does. It has a solid plot and features great acting but I think it's re-watchability really comes from, I don't the aesthetic? Contributions to this are the soundtrack, purple font on the opening credits, California setting, and probably the way it's shot among other things. 
I was born in 1992 so I am not looking for an accurate depiction of the 80's, rather an idealized version of it. It's like I have nostalgia for a setting or a feeling that I've only experienced through film... deep I know.
So if that made any sense... could anyone help me out?

I have already gotten the soundtrack and more Kavinsky stuff. His music is awesome and even the cover art for his album is kind of what I'm seeking."

Yesterday was 1 month from the date that I quit taking xanax. I have recently started having a little bit of restless sleep again, but other than that I have felt great. Despite the many warnings that I had about possible seizures, I have been lucky and had none. It's so nice to not have to worry about not being able to find them, coming up with the money to get more, and whether or not I'm gonna be sick if I can't find them. I have been tempted on a few occasions to take them because I've had several people offer them to me because they didn't know I had quit, but so far I have been able to say no. I don't have much control when it comes to wanting to take them if I have them and I don't want to have to start all over again. Thanks for everyone's kind words and support on my first post.

3446,"I have a long list of sci-fi I want to take in from my Goodreads. When dealing with Heinlein, I started with _The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_ (for no particular reason).

Then my fellow nerds, on G+, told me I should give _Starship Troopers_ a try. So I did.

After fully ingesting that, I was told ""you are finally ready for _Stranger in a Strange Land_""; and thus I was.

These books have changed my life. I now have a renewed Libertarian spirit (Mistress), a sense of duty to my society (Troopers), and an understanding that most of society's rules are a construct that I need to shed as sure as a snake sheds its skin (Stranger).

I want to take in _more_ of these works _if_ any can be as entertaining, raw, and force me into introspection like these have.

3453,"I'm looking for something that deals primarily in the exploration of unknown space and planets, preferably with a good amount of speculative astronomy and xenobiology.  Meaning a focus on actually exploring and encountering new worlds and life, whether it be a single ship exploring or a large scale epic of an entire civilization discovering space.  

I want the focus to be on the exploration so please avoid recommending stories that are too military heavy (although some military is fine) and it doesn't have to be too hard on the SF as long as there's plenty of speculative science.

For an example of what I don't want, I've tried House of Suns but it's  too focused on characters I don't care about and from what I've seen really doesn't get into the exploration end of things quickly enough.

A Long Way to a Small Angry Planet is close to what I'm looking for, but it's more of a tour of known space rather then an exploration of the unknown."

3488,"This might fall completely flat, but since we all love to give so much, I think this is a way we can all give both to each other and our community with equal measure.  

In my junior year of college, my roommate and I would write little notes of encouragement and leave them on the sidewalk below our balcony for people to stumble across. These were simple little riddles, dares, doggerels, and general well-wishes meant to entertain those walking (and stumbling) home late at night, in addition to entertaining us from our aerial vantage.  


I had a lot of fun with this but wanted to ramify our little project into something more specific for the good people of RAoA. So here's what I'd like for you guys to do:  

1. Write a note-- something thought-provoking, encouraging, or otherwise edifying-- to a stranger. Creativity in terms of both message and medium is strongly encouraged (for instance, we used to write notes on handmade paper and seal them off with a little bit of wax).  

2. Make your way to a local bookstore or library and put the note in a  favorite or influential book. Snap a quick shot of the book before putting the book back on the shelf **(timestamp it)**.

3. Post your photo of the book along with either a transcript or photo of the note itself (with the written content clearly visible) in this thread.



I know many of you are avid readers, so I think this can be fun for most of us. I'll try to participate as well, and I'll probably put more than just a note (pressed flowers, maybe a dollar bill or something, I don't know).


Here's where I need RAoA's advice: should I select a winner based off of which entry I feel is ""the best"" or just at random? I don't really feel myself in the position to judge, but I want to promote quality, especially when it's clear that someone devoted more time and effort than most everyone else. Maybe a vote? I don't know. Hell, I'd even be willing to offer two prizes-- one for each system-- if you guys think that would work better.

I'll update this post with an edit when I get a sense of what people would prefer. The contest will end 2/10/13 at 10:00PM PST, and the prize will be a $20-30 prize.  


And just in case I do end up using the randomizer, **please include the word ""halcyon"" in your entry post.** Best of luck to all!



Edit: I will be using the randomizer, but if I feel like something speaks to me personally I will send a small ""side"" gift to them as well. "

3490,"I have a question about faith. It's a matter I've thought about periodically for years. At times it seems the answer is simple and straightforward, at other times it appears to be a convoluted endeavor of theological/philosophical taxation.

The question is this: if we say we believe in something, say Christianity, are we at the same time saying we don't KNOW that it is certain/true? 

We don't have to believe in facts, we get to	""know"" them. We have to believe in things that are not conclusively proven. This may sound obvious; if it does, I ask you to humor me. But how do guys you answer the question and how does that response play out in your faith (e.g. how you communicate Christianity to nonbelievers, your overall confidence in your beliefs, etc.)."

Lifestyle change begins 01/2012

I think there are few words that feel as ugly and awkward as the word obese. Its the kind of word that always follows a sympathetic pause in the presence of the paunchy. It is so round and clinical and weighted down with taciturn lowness that it clings to a person in a way that squeezes and cripples him with what is simultaneously the most formidable and and the most elementary malady for a person to beat. January 5, marked one year since I resolved to change myself.This essay will probably be the most gushing and candid thing I’ve ever written, parts of this may seem attention seeking or boastful but I promise that this comes from the deepest, most sincere, and thought-worn parts of my heart. Its something I’ve had kicking around in my head for the better part of 15 years; this is the eulogy for my obesity.

Size has always dominated me, I began to chub around the fourth grade. I wouldn’t say that I was by any means a too-sad kid but I do think that feeling sad was a trigger for me. As a kid I had a difficult time finding a place where I felt like I was supposed to be. Whenever I would venture a try at something new, I would inevitably leave inadequate. I would feel bitter about being rejected by girls or I would feel sad about not being able to keep up with boys. In response I withdrew and went to food. As I grew up, I never felt right and I never I had anything that was mine with which to excel…I would fantasize about accomplishment and taking ownership of the kind of charisma and strength that would enamour me to those girls and make myself a hero in the minds of those guys, but I had lost so much ground over time that the idea of changing anything was daunting. It felt like my life was looming over me and I used food and humor as a means to swat it.

Gaining weight was mostly gradual with a few sharp spikes. It went on slowly until one day I realized that I was a fat kid and at once the idea got stuck in my head. I remember this feeling of compliance like:""well, this is me now."" As I grew older and boundaries widened, I became heavier. I would ride my bike to the Meijer on Clyde Park when it had a McDonalds in it and I would eat a Double Quarter meal Super-Sized and a twenty-piece chicken nuggets, turn around and ride home. This secret meal would lay on top of everything else I eaten during the day and I would enjoy it with stealth in my mind. It didn’t help that I was also slow to develop socially; I didn't have friends yet and food became music for me. It entertained and occupied me. I would go to movies by myself (which I loved doing) I would devour my lonely popcorn and inhale my propitious Pepsi. With every little bit of freedom I enjoyed, my weight gain would apex and level off. When I got my first job (at a pizza joint) I had tons of free food and money to spend on whatever I liked, when I got my license I could travel farther for different brands and combinations of fast food. Every bit of independance further cemented my habits.

Eventually I did develop a bit of a social lean but I still had a hard time accepting myself to my peers, I always felt like my stature stood between us. For example, one year we went to Michigan Adventure, I hadn’t thought much about the seat in a roller coaster and and never had a problem with a lap bar, but then I got in line for The Corkscrew. We waited eagerly and when the time came I walked up to the cart and looked inside and I thought ""shit."" I sat down next to a friend and it was tight but we were both able to sit. I reach up to pull down the shoulder harness and it wouldn’t click. My chest is too far from my back to get the harness to lock. I want to get out but instead an employee comes to me and tries to help by pressing it into me while I 'suck it in' No dice. I stood up and walked away with all the eyes on my back. I held the ride up and I was that fat kid that didn’t fit so I watched my friends ride the coaster from the sidewalk. It was the first time my size made me feel t isolated in front of someone. My attitude was to quietly tack roller coasters on to a list of things I couldn’t do. Eventually I out grew movie theater seats, airplane seats, and ‘Big & Tall’ sections in the mall and I passively waved goodbye to all of them.

And time just passed by - I built powerful, lasting, and comfortable relationships. I worked and had fun but never really achieved anything. I had quiet goals but all of the things I wanted for myself came to be plain conversational fodder, things you get drunk and dream about out loud. Everything I wanted was so public and everything I was was so private. I wanted to act and I wanted to be a comedian. I did open mics and it left me disgusted and exposed, it was a sort of exhilarating misery that kept you facing the goals you pushed away. I gradually lost momentum and just sort of stalled. Life for a few years was like a room dimly lit by the flickering light of a TV. It was quiet, and private, and comfortable. I remained stealthily obsessed with food. It occupied my mind. The flavors and textures and that feeling of occupation in your core gave me a sense of contentment that was so durable that it became ever-present in my life.

I haven’t always lacked a sense of the need for change. Periodically, I would have manic bouts of conviction and backbone. I would face the world and strive to be social, and better, and healthy. I would purse comedy again, I joined gyms, I sought and gained relationships...complacency though eventually had me back in my room eroding from a habit bordering agoraphobia. Eventually I realized that I wasn’t the possessor friends I once was and I became aware of the cheerlessness I felt for myself and that revealed to me the delicacy of the relationships I had. I was pushing people away from me so that I could revel in my faults. I began to see the folly and futility of so many of the years behind me. I became morbidly mindful of my mortality; I would imagine a roommate finding me dead and how they would react. How my family would react. In that, I realized that I’d lived so absent mindedly for so long that I had become OK with being dead when I was 40 and had subconsciously planned to be alone and idle for whatever time I had left. I’d let indulgence and apathy become intuitive.

A dramatic shift in my mindset came to pass around summer 2011. It was also around this time that I, as none of my friends or family knew, auditioned for a weight loss reality show. On the show, overweight men and women are taken away to a fitness sanctuary where they are taught healthy habits and exercise and exercise and exercise ... it was much like a real-life adult version of the movie Heavyweights. While gone, participants don’t communicate with family or friends and then, after an agonizing and heart lifting episode is complete, they are revealed to friends and family in a new body and attitude. I wanted to be a part of that show and thought I had it. I was interviewed and inline to be a part of the show when, abruptly, the series was put on hold and the new season never materialized.

I was devastated. I had poured my future into this idea that I could be taken away and fixed. That I was going to leave and come back as a new person for everyone to hold up cheer for. I had built up tremendous optimism and lost it all just as quickly. I went right back onto the destructive beat I had just left. Looking back, not making it on that show broke something for me and pushed me to get bad enough that I could get better.

Fortunately it only took about six months, I grieved the loss of my spotlight and my champion transformative moment and during that time reflected soulfully about who I am to the people in my life, who I am to myself, and most importantly recognized that I have it in myself to become the kind of person I want to be: I want to constantly be aware of my potential. I want to be a man that knows and practices right from wrong. I want to modestly inspire goodness, optimism, and effort in people; I want my integrity and my character to be something worth holding up. I want to be external and in the lives of people and I want people to feel that having me in their lives is a thing of value. In order to realize these things I had to accept accountability for what had misrepresented my capability and demeaned my resolve for so long. It wasn’t my weight, it was my attitude about life and an enduring lack of enthusiasm for the future.

I took responsibility for my well being one year ago, I weighed 420 pounds, I wore a XXXXXL dress shirt and 48 jeans. My life and the way I lived it literally changed overnight and hasn’t stumbled. I began by eating a calorie restricted diet and eventually shifted to focus on lower carbohydrates. For exercise I started by walking three miles a day. I would take the bus to school, get off walk a ways and get back on further down the route. Once spring rolled around I began to bike. Those rides progressed from two, to six, to ten mile rides, mostly to and from school. Soon the distance between school and home wasn’t clear or long enough so riding became a purposeful thing rather than utility. I rode and rode. By the end of the summer I had joined the half century club having ridden over fifty miles in one ride. In August I began running using the Couch to 5k program and ran my first full 5k on November 17 and putted along to finish my first 10k on December 15. As of today I have lost 178 pounds, wear a large and 34 jeans. I am stronger and faster than I’ve ever felt myself be. I feel appreciation and optimism in everything that I do and I sense that this is the way life should feel. I’ve still got a lot of work to do but at this point the habits have rooted and the education that I’ve gained over the last year will nurture them. I cannot see my life going backwards, this is who I was always supposed to be.

I’ve spent most of my life planning and daydreaming without action and now everything seems so attainable.This is why I write today, I’m ready to say goodbye to that old life now and to focus on maintaining goal oriented momentum and pushing harder so that the strength in my musings becomes the strength in my character. I can do better, I can do better. I can be the Greatest Man in the World.

Thank you to Mom, my Dad, Jerry, My brothers Eric and Adam, Jessica, Marshall, Corey, Colby; you guys specifically have given me clarity and always been frank with be about delicate things. And to Britt, Allen, Jen, Margie, and Alex, you guys give me the happiness I need to suck it up and do it. This might all seem overly sentimental but I only plan on doing this once and you’ve changed my life in ways that can’t really make sense to you.

Part of the audition process for the reality show I mentioned was to create a series of videos focusing on different aspects of my life. I edited one of them and am keeping a few private, but as for the rest, I don’t see a reason to keep it closeted anymore, I feel like that person is gone now. I uploaded these in May 2011, until now it has been accessible only to the producers of the show. For those interested, I have the links listed below. I think they are a thought-provoking relic.

I wanted to share a brief mission statement/vision for r/Sikh as there has been some instability/upheaval recently.

My hope is that we can create a vibrant and active community that can share resources, kirtan, katha, and seva opportunities with each other. I hope this community will be supportive of each other, will work with each other, uplift each other, and see Vaheguru's jot in each other.

Let's be civil, polite, courteous, and all things Sikh and embark on this path together

3504,"So anytime I feel the ""urge"" or sense a ""trigger"" scenario coming on, I immediately jump to this forum for moral support and to be reminded on why I started this journey in the first place .  This forum has strangely become an effective substitute for my PMO addiction.  And since this forum is nothing without the rest of you Fapstronauts, I'd like to send out a big THANK YOU for keeping this community active and supportive.

I'm curious, does anybody else use this forum as their 911?"
3505,"Would love to hear some recommendations from you guys as I will have a lot of reading time!  I've read most of the classics (Asimov, Clarke, Dick, Heinlein etc).  Other books I've really loved have been the Forever War (Joe Haldeman), Blood Music (Greg Bear), pretty much anything by Neal Stephenson except Reamde and most of Iain M Banks' stuff (all of which I've read).  I just finished Old Man's War by Joe Scalzi and loved that.

3507,"Hey guys, I have talked a few times in church about this, and I feel like it's a good idea to talk about it on here and get some outside input. Music is a very powerful thing! When I would ride in my ambulance, I would listen to metal to get my adrenaline going so i could balance out by the time I got on scene. When I was deployed, we would plug a boom box into our trucks and listen to rap to laugh and feel better about where we were. 


Now, let me be clear on the get go here, hymns are thee greatest way to express our emotions to god. They are a prayer, and a commitment we make. They have the power to change moods, minds, and hearts. However, I do not, as I doubt anyone does, expect members to only listen to hymns on their car ride to work. 


We are told to listen to music that invokes the spirit. But what does that mean? Some people believe it only means music that was produced by Disney (yeah, don't pretend like I'm kidding, you and I both know that one guy/gal who only knows Disney songs)

So let's discuss this a little deeper. I want to be as specific as possible in order to help answer peoples questions. And let me preface with this, even though I may feel the spirit to a song, you may not. That is not uncommon and it is OK!

3519,"Why do we fall?

90 days ago I started this journey, I started this journey more then often and always failing at some point, resetting the badge time after time.

Now I finally can say I did it, although this is not an end, its just the start to a new way of life.

I found like so many of you awesome people, that the first half is the toughest.
I thought that this calm state of mind would never come but somewhere around day 45 the calmness set in and it realy was quite and easy journey from then on.
The crazy cravings, the blue balls and your mind telling you 'ah just 1 fap' all off that will go away and you can feel your strong brain, the real you, getting its power back and simply saying; No.

One thing I read when I started was all the 'superpowers' people gained.
Everyone is different, but I dont feel that different from before. 
There are some big changes but I dont see that as some massive superpower.

The biggest change there is;
Girls

They are everywhere!

One of the best posts I read from one of you guys said:
'its not that they started to notice you, its that you start noticing them'

This is true in every way, I never was a shy guy when it came to talking to girls but Im no cassanova. I would never flirt with a girl and would not know when one was flirting with me!

Maybe this is the only superpower Ive gained, picking up and sending out signals to girls.
Im 24 and in the last 6 years before nofap, I've slept with 3 girls...

During my short nofap period I talked to more strange girls then I ever did before, ended up with more new phone numbers then in all those years and ended up waking up next to a beautiful woman 2 times!
Both of them confident, fun and older then me, 4 and 8 years older.

I have no issues with age differences, I think its how you 'click' with each other that matters and not the age, but I think it does show that these confident woman found me attractive, something like that just didnt happen before nofap.

Something else happend, a (girl) friend of mine said to me after having a nice long talk with her; 'everytime I see you I get all fuzzy and warm inside' and made some obvious remarks she was into me. She is in a long term relationship with some guy and although Im not into her it sort of felt good to hear that.
Another experience that has never happend before nofap to me...

Besides the magnificent things that are called girls, I think the best thing is just the calmness in my mind.
No crazy porn thoughts, no shame after that one last fap and no need to clear your internet surf history!

I read that a lot of guys get super into new sports and hobbies and stuff like that.
I like just to continue living like I did, sure I picked up my guitar more and started exercising more, but thats a logical cause of nofap. 
Youve got to keep yourself busy and your mind away from that computer.
Once you get bored and youve got nothing to do, thats when the urges come.

So no fantastic new hobby, no massive abs and strong musscles, no meditation and zen master for me.
Just enjoying life like before, with a beer and my ps3 but now knowing there is a smoking hot chick waiting for me in the other room ;)

Good luck my interweb friends, just know it does get better.

Why do we fall?
To get back up again.

I'd like to go hunting for some awesome colors, shapes & textures.  When I think of rocks in the Austin area, I think of brown rocks, light brown rocks, dark brown rocks, tan rocks, tan brown rocks, chunks of limestone and fragments of frisbees.

** back to mixing the new album. thank you all for the q&a, we had fun! -sr"
3524,"91 days, whatever--I think it's a little behind anyway.  

Background:  Divorced single Dad, 38, never had any huge problem with porn, MO maybe 3-4x/wk.  Stumbled across this sub, read for a bit, and jumped in.  I've always been a very self-disciplined person, I typically just need a reason to do something.  Reading all the benefits/experiences/etc, was all I needed.  

Other things I have done, just for some background:  

Got back in the gym serious just before starting noFap.  I think this is critical, and probably has more to do with my success than anything else, including noFap.  If some of you guys don't know what you're doing, google 5x5 Stronglifts--it's a fantastic starting program.  Just remember, heavy, compound movements make everything bigger.  Don't be one of those guys doing bicep curls on the squat rack, please.  
I've set several PRs, and am on track to DL 315 in March.  

Quit drinking.  Now, I've never had any issue here.  But I do like beer, and not cheap stuff either.  Aside from a bottle of wine over Christmas, and a pint of great local craft brew on New Year's Eve.  Benefits?  I have more $$$ in my pocket, haha.  I don't intend to totally abstain from alcohol, but it's been an interesting side experiment.  

I've started hiking too.  I live in the mountains of NC, and can't believe that I have failed to take advantage of this before.  I love being out, and have long-term plans of attacking the AT one day.  

I'm eating much better/cleaner.  I've started cooking every night, and it is amazing how fun it is, and how good the food is.  If you need help here, try emeals.  Just put in how many you are cooking for and where you shop, and they will generate a weekly recipe/ingredient list.  For two, it typically runs around $50-$60/week in food, after you stock up on the staples (spices, seasoning, etc).  I hate processed food now, and my daughter loves what we've been eating.  

Now, my experiences.  Truthfully, it was pretty easy for me--as I said before, I just need a good reason to do something, and I'm all in.  Reading other people's experiences on relapse was definitely a great motivator as well, I knew that I would feel like crap, and I didn't want that.  I started a new job that I've been chasing for a year about a month into this, and have found it's so much easier to concentrate and get things done.  As others have said, the 'brainfog' is gone, and I feel much more alert, and have a clarity of thinking that is awesome.  I did get the week-in testosterone spike, which was awesome!  Regarding flatlines/etc.  I did experience a couple of these, but it wasn't bad.  Having dealt with real depression, a sexual libido flatline is really nothing.  In fact, I'm not so sure that 'flatline' is accurate.  I'm thinking it's more of a natural cycle, almost like women have.  Anyway, I'm currently in the 'horny-as-balls' stage, so that's kind of nice.  Forgot to mention, this has been hard-mode.  There is someone that I've seen on and off for the last year or so, but we've not spent that kind of time together since I began.  But the next time, watch out!  No wet dreams, I did have a little discharge yesterday morning after I woke up, but no orgasm.  I'm not having another orgasm without a woman, period.  

So I've done the 90 days, but there is no end in sight to this.  I have no intention of going back to that ever, but I won't beat myself up if it happens a time or two.  But, it will never become a habit again.  

Thanks to all of you for your stories, inspiration, and support.  Stay strong, and I may check in now and again.  "

3528,"This post is for the bottom of the subreddit. This is to pass through the ranks of new submissions and quietly disappear into the bowels of reddit obscurity, completely unnoticed.

If you are reading this, then let us commune together here. This here is a person, animated by soul, who wants to reach out to you and connect with you. I don’t know who you are, but if I continue to speak to you from this deep place, then I can rest safely assured that it is touching the same place in you.

I have a secret to tell you. I was meditating the other day in a coffee shop (it must have looked like I was napping). I was contemplating emptiness. I was sitting just right there, and all I was doing was observing to see if any thoughts wanted to cling to and override my conscious attention. And after some time, I finally realized that you and I are fundamentally the same.

I want you to know that I pass through a lot of my life afraid. Often about little things. I’m always on my guard. I see the same people every day, at work and outside of work, but I’m far too afraid to open up to them, so I never do. We don’t really know each other. In a way, you already know me much better than they do.

Things are scary for me right now because I’m dropping a lot. I’m really dropping a lot of my thoughts, identity and plans. I’ve begun to hover delicately in a placeless place. Inside, I am spacious. Very spacious.

But I’m so excited, my dear friend! Everything is so exciting. I am moving deeper and deeper into my own ego death. And it really feels like death.

Yes, you and I are not different. I can see that now. We’re came from the same place. Where we came from, you and I are not distinct entities. This is why I know you are struggling with the same things that I’m struggling with. This is why I know that I already know you. Can’t you feel it??

Our destiny is to meet and to merge. You and I are slowly learning about the pain we are causing and we are ceasing to cause it every day. I am the universe. I could cry, I love you so much.

So let this be just for us. Meet me here in this spacious, timeless place, now. You are completely safe here.

3538,"I used to be super lazy, out of shape, overly sarcastic, socially awkward, you name it. But around a month ago, I realized what was stopping me from becoming a better person was myself; I was just judging myself for wanting to become one of those ""stupid"" positive motivational kids. But I decided to exercise daily, limit myself to an hour of gaming each day (I was SUPER addicted to Minecraft) and do some arts and music.

Boy it feels wonderful. I now love piano and no longer have to piss off my piano instructor. I found foraging, which I love. I've got plenty of plans for this year already. I'm sleeping better and at more healthy times. I'm even seeing positive things in school, which I used to hate a lot.
Today I went on a game emulator. Oh, what fun! But when I got off I was fucking scared. My body ached again, it was later than I thought, and I was feeling like the old idiot me. No. I changed and 
I'm not going back.

3540,"I'm saving my actual progress photos to when I actually reach my goal weight, but I thought I'd mention it here anyway. It's pretty awesome. [Here's](http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/379177_2135756449874_2135028497_n.jpg) what I looked like before I actually started dieting. Ignore the shaving cream though, lol.

My start weight was 225, and I weighed myself earlier today and I was around 210 to 206. The scale is from the early 90s so it's a little inaccurate at times. 

What inspired me the most was [u/NeoSlasher's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/167niz/what_losing_55_pounds_can_do_for_your_face/) and and immediately started dieting the next day. So big thanks to him.

All I did was limit my caloric intake to 1500kcal a day and that's it. No exercise as of yet. It's really easy and I'm so upset I didn't do it sooner, haha. I eat whatever I want, just so long as I watch the calories. 

What I do is before each meal, is drink two cups of water 30 minutes before I eat, that way I'm already somewhat full. Most times I won't do this unless it's a super unhealthy meal like McDonalds or something (Which I haven't eaten in weeks.)

Another thing is that my mother would hide the scale from me every two weeks, so I wouldn't get discouraged or anything. It really works for me. 

My actual goal weight is 180-175, and I'm hoping to lose that in about five to six months, hopefully. 

But yeah, watch out for my thread in a few months to see the final stage.

I also want to thank this community. Everyone is so nice from what I've gathered from the little time I've actually been here and I unfortunately don't post enough on this subreddit. I should though."

So my story is that Jesus changed me at a Younglife camp the summer after my freshman year in high school. It's been four years since and my life has been totally changed by the Gospel. My first couple years of following Jesus PMO wasn't an issue. There wasn't even a temptation. But my senior year it slowly creeped into my life and I've been struggling intensely for the past two years. I recently rediscovered the Gospel and am on fire for Christ right now and ready to kick this thing. I'm currently attending Indiana University and leading a high school ministry there. I'm excited to get involved in this group and get some extra accountability!

Today, I'm curious about how you're handling similar topics. Here, I'll be using the term ""uplifting"" to refer primarily to giving sapience to non-sapient creatures, but you can also use it to refer to giving advanced technologies to less technologically developed cultures.

1. Has humanity uplifted any animals from Earth to sapience? 

2. Have they uplifted any alien animals from other worlds?

3. Have any other aliens uplifted any species, including possibly humans?

4. Do you have any particularly unusual examples of uplifting or interesting anecdotes?

I remember as a youngster, I had a ton of questions, but I believe my main was, how the hell do pro(and am) skaters do those high ass ollies?

3553,"So far, a lot of different types of anime have changed me and made me start trying new things.

I now train harder and workout better than ever because of Bakki the Grappler. The World God Only Knows has made me start playing and finishing my games more efficiently (I tried God Mode, to difficult). I also study harder thanks to many cliche anime situations that are held in high school. So what anime did you guys watch that made you try something new or made you better?

3556,"Today, I went to a clinic to have some tendinitis in my shoulder checked out. While getting my medical history, they grabbed the typical vitals of temperature, blood pressure and pulse.

My heart rate was 55 bpm. I wasn't sure I was looking at the right number, so I asked, ""Does that say my pulse is 55?""

""Yep. We call that a runner's pulse,"" the nurse says.

Holy crap, my heart rate has never been that low before! It used to be around 80-90 bpm most of the time. It's amazing how strong my heart has gotten!

While I should mention that before the C25K, I was doing HIIT cardio on an elliptical for a few months prior, it's worth pointing out that there are plenty of other benefits to us completing the 9 weeks besides being endurance and smaller pants. :)"

3562,"Just a few hours ago, I was crying in the bathroom at work softly (or so I thought). A woman who had just finished washing her hands asked me if I needed some water and I said, ""No, thank you. I'm fine,"" in what must have been a very unconvincing voice.

She left the bathroom and I struggled to pull myself together. I got up and blew my nose, trying to not blow snot over myself when I heard the bathroom door open again. 

She was back with a handful of soft tissues. You know those special kind with the lotion on them?

She handed them under the stall door and said, ""Here. These are a lot softer than toilet paper.""

I took them and choked out the words thank you and she left me to clean myself up.

After she left I just started crying harder than before. Her kindness was exactly what I needed. It was such a small thing to do, but I felt so overwhelmed with the sense that everything will be okay. I just want her to know how much I appreciate her kindness.

3567,"Hello, I just wanted to post an update on my weight loss journey thus far. I am a full-time student, 21, and 5'5. Cheers!

So, I won't try to make this too wordy, and of course if anybody has any questions I'll be more than glad to answer them, but, hey, here goes:

So, like just about everybody else who's ever been overweight, I've been obese all of my life. It wasn't until the summer of my freshman year of college that I decided to lose weight, officially. I started out with P90X (modifying it heavily) and with some book called ""The Fat Smash Diet"" by Ian K. Smith, but eventually just dropped both and continued dieting on my own.

The diet consisted of no red meats, potatoes, rices, gluten, or dairy, with a few tweaks (sweet potatoes, almond milk, yogurt, and (cottage) cheese were allowed). This diet wasn't told to me by a nutritionist or anything, I just implemented it on my own (and, granted, I don't know anything about nutrition, I just did what worked for me). That helped me to lose the majority of my weight (and still helps me lose today).

Exercise in my journey thus far has never been very crucial (of course, I used to be heavy, and was susceptible to many an excuse due to my weight when in reality I was just lazy). However, I did exercise in spouts, as motivation to do so would come and go. I didn't really start working out/lifting weights religiously (""religiously"" meaning six days a week) until this last semester, 08/12-12/12. I ran a lot, lifted a lot, and strove for a more active lifestyle, and it was good.

However, with all of the weight loss, there comes loose skin, which led me to my surgeries. Abdominoplasty 01/07/13, and liposuction on the chest 01/10/13. I don't want to get too into details on these surgeries (because I could probably go on for days), so here's the short and skinny:

-altogether, the operations were about $11,000.
-I am still in recovery, and recovery comes in stages, broken down (for me) as: 1) Drains out in >2 weeks, 2) girdle and chest constraint (sort of like a sleeveless vest) off in 5-6 weeks, 3) swelling reduced in 3-6 months, and 4) feeling returning to stomach in at least a year, if not more, if not at all.       
-I am very glad to have undergone the surgery, as the human body continually changes and can be manipulated through dedication (Rome wasn't built in a day, neither was your body, right?)

I guess that's about it, more or less. There's probably a lot more that I'm leaving out, I can always come back and edit this out if there are requests for more information. Thank you for reading! 

or

TL;DR: Lost 125 pounds, had surgeries, posted pictures, obliged to the mandatory ""TL;DR"" ending. "

3569,"Hi guys,

I am a big guy...BMI over 30 and I have really been thinking about running to lose weight... But I am suffer from large moobs..

I really wanted your honest thoughts on what you dedicated fellows see when you see a fat man running ....struggling...

Deep down - do you laugh at the person? Do you snicker? What is it that goes through your heads when you see such a situation?

Dont worry - if you do feel like the guy is a loser or any such thing - just be honest! It would help me - and certainly other big people know how to react (or how to strengthen the mind) before running

Thanks guys for your opinions (and honesty!)

Edit:

Guys! Thank you! I mean there is absolutely no way I could have expected such a warm response and I hope that this post will help all those people peeking into this sub-reddit for the first time.

Thank you very much runners! You cannot believe how much anxiety exists within my mind (and I am sure in a number of 'big' people's minds - this goes a very long way in reducing that!

I want to tell each and every single one of you who replied to this post (and I appreciate the honesty most of all!) - Thank You! From a fellow human being - this really warms my heart!

Thanks again guys! I will definitely put on my trainers this coming Saturday and belt out a couple of kilometres.

3570,"I've been doing keto for a little over a week now (down 11 pounds!) and I've been feeling like I'm prancing around on cloud 9 the past few days. My doctor suggested that I do a low carb/high fat diet because of my anxiety and exhaustion(and I could stand to lose 30 pounds). After being on and off anxiety medications, I'm now off them but yet I feel better than I can ever remember! I'm so happy, I'm so energetic that my fiancé said ""You need to try to calm down and try to go to bed."" He was shocked when it's 2am and I'm crazy energetic after waking up at 8am. It's also the first time in my ENTIRE life(well, the parts I remember) that I don't have body image issues. 

You guys are so awesome!! I'm so glad I stumbled upon this subreddit and made the decision to listen to my doctor. This is the most supportive community on reddit and I'm so glad to be a part of it. 

Good luck on your keto diets everyone!"

She asked specifically what I use internet for, so make sure you're 'needs' are still for the package you have, or they may try to lower your upload/download.

DirectTV, told them I wanted to cancel my service because I couldn't afford the monthly package.  They asked about what I viewed yada yada, (told them I still wanted same package, just lowered price) She asked if adding movie channels would help, and I said no, I literally just need less payment per month. She was able to take off $35 a month, and ended up throwing in movie channels for a few months.

3578,"Nothing too drastic but I managed to get my student loans to under 10k as of this morning after 10 years of continuous paying.  I just wanted to post this to remind myself that there's a light at the end of the tunnel and I'm making a mad dash towards the finish line.


That is all.  Thanks  :D

*Edit:  Since some people asked, I had 30k in student loans but not for the reasons that you think.  During my 1st two years of undergrad, I was living with my dad.  At first, I was paying my tuition from a part time job as a front desk supervisor in downtown Denver.  Along the way, my dad got hurt on the job so I had to juggle between working full time, going to school full time, and taking care of my dad while he healed.  After two years or so of doing this (it was not fun at all D: ) , my dad finally moved out moved back home with my mom but I was about $30k in the hole since financially I just couldn't keep up.  I then started looking at scholarships/grants or whatever that helped me pay my tuition.  Luckily, I managed to get a full-ride during at the end of my sophomore year (and good thing too because I was literally a week away from dropping out of college before I got my scholarship letter).  I've been digging myself out little by litte by moving in with people, cutting expenses, and determining what I really need vs what I really want (my toughest challenge).*"
3579,"I came back on reddit for the first time in months today and realized that there were a lot of angry gamer here. I understand why you are angry but I can assure you that there is developpement being done. I know that there is a lot of discussion about the t-shirts and I suppose it is because we talked about it a lot. The reason we talked about it is because we want to get rid of that aspect of the kickstarter. This is a lot of work and kickstarter didn't really helped us out with their shitty form. BUT we don't work on that all day. We do a lot of experimenting. Personally I work a lot on migrating our database on better servers. We already tried Herok/appfog but they didn't worked like we wanted so we are trying another solution. We need something solid for the type of gaming we are aiming for and something that work 3/4 of the time is not good enoug.. you might have seen some issues on the http://sauropodstudio.com. We used the same system for our game.

The radial menu is a big change in the gameplay. It is something that will completly change the way you create/build/etc and it was a big issue in the prototype version of the game. There is  a lot more to tell but I will let Germain talk about it when he's ready.

we finally found a way to patch efficiently the game. We first started with a custom way to do it but it was a complete hell, then we looked for different specialized company like Solid State Network or Pando but they have ridiculous pricing. We finally found a solution but I cannot talk about it yet since i'm under a NDA. 

big changes on the pathfinding systems too. that more François's work so I cannot tell what are the technicals differences but it's working way better at this point. 

Our newcommer Paolo is working on the multiplayer and he's working a lot with me testing new systems. We also work on the new castlestory.net website that will change a lot. 

We have our sound guy working here, creating and implementing, I didn't had the chance to hear what was recently implemented because I'm almost never there at the same time of the others. 

But what took us a lot of time too is moving to the studio. You might say that is not for what you backed us but since the whole team was almost living at my appartment I must say it is maybe the most important thing we needed to do. I had to be at my home from 8am to 9pm since not everyone here work on the same hours. Not being able to live a social life for 4 months was a bit hard but I always thouht that it was only for a little time. We aren't even completly settled yet but it's getting together. I personally miss my good internet connection but for everything else is is getting enjoyable. 

So there is a lot of other changes but I think you understand that we don't really talk about paperwork and things like that. 

If you have questions, ask them. I will try to come here more often. I'm usanlly not a reddit guy but I know that a lot of our community came from here so I will make an effort :)"
3580,"EDIT: This is not scientific proof of anything. This is simply me recalling a dream in which I believe I met something representing my unconscious mind.

Background: on October 12, 2011, when I was 20, I got extremely drunk and fell asleep on my grandparents' back porch. I was incapacitated. My grandfather took advantage of the situation. As many could imagine, I was a bit broken by the experience. I did not recover my sense of self until two weeks ago when I watched a jury of twelve decide his guilt. This Wednesday I will go to his sentencing and watch him condemned to prison.

About two-two and a half months after the incident I had an LD that shook me to my core, and it's because I believe I met a part of myself that is somewhat separate from ""me"".


This is an interpretation (with character and plot explanations) of what I wrote down in the morning when I awoke:



The dream began in the community that I grew up in. It was summer and I saw the neighborhood exactly as it had been when I first moved there at 13. I ran up my front porch and into my house to find my mother, a friend of hers, and my friend Amber sitting at the dinner table. I joined them and we chatted about nothing for a few minutes before Amber’s father called her to come home. She lived directly across the street from me, so she returned after only a couple of minutes.

“My dad’s coming over for some food,” she said, rolling her eyes.

“There’s enough for him!” chimed my mom. “Phil’s welcome any time.”

I heard our screen door open and something struck me as odd. It was when I saw his face that I realized I was dreaming. I quickly stood up and looked around me. 

“Great!” I exclaimed. 

Everyone looked stunned. 

“I’m dreaming,” I explained passively. “Phil, you’re dead.”

“I don’t feel dead,” he said thoughtfully. 

I took him by the arm and led him to my door. Before opening it I looked him in the eyes and said, “Four years ago you took a shotgun to your head in your shed. I saw that shed before I came in here for dinner. I know for a fact that the shed was removed after your suicide, and when I open this door you will see an empty slab of cement where it used to be.”

I opened the door and pulled him out onto the porch with the others close behind. I pointed to the place where the shed had once stood, and then looked back at my company to see how they were taking the news. Phil vanished in front of my eyes; my mother and her friend became hysterical and ran back into the house; and Amber sported a horrified look of betrayal.

“You killed my father,” she whispered sinisterly.

“Calm down,” I said, “none of this is real.” 

I did not fear Amber in this dream. I felt protective if anything because I felt the dream momentarily destabilize and had to struggle to keep some amount of control over it. I heard a deep rumble and swung back around to face the surrounding neighborhood. The houses began to crumble, leaving only half of each one standing. Some crumbled vertically, some horizontally, and I grabbed Amber and swung her off of the porch on the off chance that I accidentally knocked my own house down on top of her. I had no concern for my mother and her friend, as they were out of my sight, and therefore no longer technically there. 

SIDENOTE: You’re probably going to wonder why I wanted to protect Amber, knowing that she was imaginary. The answer is: it’s good for me. It’s good for my values in and out of the dream, and it’s good for keeping me connected with the dream.
 
We began to run in between the houses, which had stopped dissolving at this point. I knew-- I just had a feeling-- that this dream was about to turn into a shit storm. I repeatedly assured Amber that nothing was going to happen to her, that I would protect her from whatever dangers were coming and that she would feel no pain. 

We were turning a corner when I saw what would be my first obstacle. A gigantic, ethereal-looking goat stood grazing in an alley of conjoined backyards. When he heard us, he looked up slowly, his jaw grinding the grass he’d collected. 

“Shit. Shit shit shit!” I whispered vehemently.
 
I stepped in front of Amber’s body to shield her before finally deciding it was time for her to leave. I wasn't about to watch something happen to her, however imaginary it was.

“Run,” I murmured seriously.

“But…” she whimpered with wide eyes.

“GO! You’re not real!” and I pushed her hard. She disappeared around the corner and I turned to face my what I assumed was my foe again.
The giant goat was slowly bearing down on me and I stood my ground uncertainly. As he walked, his head and torso began to morph into a human’s and he stood on his hind legs. Eventually, all but his legs had a human form, and he was…beautiful. Standing at least six feet tall, he had long blonde hair and a sharp jawline, and a lean, smooth body. I wasn’t sure what to make of him. I lifted my fists as if to fight and he laughed. 

“You still aren’t very good at this,” he said gruffly.  

He put his left hand on my right shoulder and pushed me down. He climbed on top of me, this satyr, and I immediately came so hard that it woke me. I considered getting up to check the mess, but decided I’d rather get back to the dream. I fell back into it with no problem, but the sexually appealing satyr was gone. 

I needed to find him. 

I want to clarify that I was not seeking him out for further sexual gratification. I began seeking him out because there was something new about the encounter.* You still aren’t very good at this.* Did he mean controlling and protecting myself in my dreams? I had been having lucid nightmares for years. 

I ran around the wasteland that used to be my neighborhood for about a half an hour before giving up and walking back to my porch to wait to wake up. I walked inside of my house to see if anyone was there but it was empty. It was then that I heard a knock at the door. I opened it to see the blonde--now in full human form--in khaki pants and an over-sized red t-shirt. He jerked his head backward as if to say come on and then made a run for it. I chased him down to a hillside strewn with boulders. He leaned against a rock arrogantly, flicking pebbles with his bare toes. 

“Thanks,” I said.

“For what?” he asked without looking at me.

“For coming back. You’re not like the others, are you?”

“I suppose not.”

(I had often spent time with vapid dream characters who simply annoyed me with their insistence that they were not of my creation, as suggested by my short dialogue with Amber, Phil, my mother, and her friend.)

“Can I bounce some ideas off you?”

“Bounce ideas off me,” he snorted derisively. “I am you.”

“Oh shut up,” I snapped, so frustrated that I was on the verge of tears. “You must have access to things I don’t.”

“For a reason, maybe?”

“Bullshit! Personalities should not be split…” I trailed off. “I’m going to make a brave speculation and say you’re my subconscious.”

“Hmm… at least part of it.” He still had not looked at me.

“Look at me, damnit.”

“You’re bossy, and I don’t really need to be here,” he said in a mock-childish voice.

“But you are,” I said. “Why do you appear so attractive to me?”

“Well, you’re lonely, aren’t you?”

“And you touched me because…”

“You looked like you needed a guilt-free orgasm.”

I continued to study him and he looked up at me
.
“This takes self-love to a whole new level,” he chuckled.

I began to cry. “I can tell you’re stronger that me.”

“No,” he said sternly. “You’ve forgetting that I am you. Isn’t that what you’re always wasting your time explaining to these dream people?”

I sobbed silently. It was getting harder to focus on the dream; my surroundings were starting to slip. 

“You’ve got to help me! I don’t want to wake up!”

His hard demeanor cracked and I saw pity in his eyes.

“You know it doesn’t work like that, trifling_turkey. You know that. You’ll wake up every morning until you don’t, and when that day comes neither of us will be here.”

This is the last solid sentence I remember coming from him, as my hysterical state was throwing the dream into disarray. 

I’m going to give you the real crazy now (I didn’t realize this until a few months ago): ever since the “meeting with my subconscious”, I’ve had a prominent, somewhat sarcastic voice egging me on through things I would not have been previously able to accomplish. When I get really low, the voice begins overthrowing my defeatism in an aggressive manner. 

“Make your bed, trifling_turkey, it’s not that complicated. You can do this,” it will say, or, “Put that fucking bottle down, you drunkard, you’re on your way to destroying everything again.” Occasionally, I can banter with this voice and tell it to back off if it’s being a dick, but generally it’s looking out for my best interests and I accept it as part of me. 

Did I trigger this when I asked for help in the dream? People will argue.

3586,"The first time I finished reading the Book of Mormon, I was only about 10 years old. I was lucky in that my parents and leaders had taught me early on how to recognize the spirit. Because of this, I was able to gain a testimony of that amazing book at a very early age. 

I'm 34 years old now and I've read the Book of Mormon more times than I can remember. Each time I read it, the spirit gives me peace and understanding which confirms to me that the book is true.

Recently, I watched *The Lion King* with my daughter. There is a part in *The Lion King* where Mufasa appears in the clouds and tells Simba that Simba has forgotten him and therefore forgotten who he is. When I watched this, I was almost moved to tears.

Fortunately, as I mentioned before, I was taught from a young age how to recognize the spirit. I know now that *The Lion King* is true. Simba is the one true king of Pride Rock and Mufasa is watching over us. And despite the lack of evidence that there is a Pride Rock or that lions are able to talk, I know that if you watch *The Lion King* with an open heart and allow yourself to be receptive to the spirit, you can also know of its truth.

In Mufasa's name,
Amen.

(This story is actually 100% true except that, instead of coming to believe in talking lions, it's one of the things that helped me finally let go of that ""confirmation"" I had at 10 years old that kept me pushing away my doubts for 30 years. Silly, I know. But it's the little things, I guess.)"

3588,"I'm curious too know about any times that religion has prevented any kind of Scientist from making some sort of advancement in the world of science. I often see posts and comments from this sub reddit that imply, or outright state, that since a majority of the population of the first world (U.S, U.K, and etc.) is religious, that it somehow brings down advancement and understanding of the scientific facts.

The Top comment on this post is an example of what i'm talking about (Forgive me, I don't really know how to link comments): http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/u25nk/something_we_should_acknowledge/

Just a bit about me so you know where I'm coming from. I myself believe in God as simply something to believe in, a moral code to follow is probably the best way to describe it. I don't consider the bible as fact, I accept science as fact. The prospect of things like Heaven and Hell are simply hopes and fears, ones that no one will ever understand until they die and find out what, if anything, happens afterwards.

So I would just like some links to stories, or explanations of stories where Religion truly prevented the continuing of Scientific advances in the Modern World. I would also prefer if the linked/explained stories were about absolute 100% prevention, and not just delays or compromised situations."

3592,"Another weird suggestion from me today. I guess I have many things on my mind.

So right now, the End is one floating island that serves as an arena to battle the Ender Dragon. But I think the End could be expanded to generate infinitely, like the Nether and Overworld do. It would be a lot different, though.

Instead of a cohesive landmass, it would be composed of widely spaced (maybe 100-200 blocks apart) floating islands, each one much like the one island we have now. In between, there'd be tiny ""waypoint"" islands. Only a few of the islands would have an Ender Dragon and the obsidian towers, and you'd have to find and defeat one of these to return to the Overworld.

On the other islands there could be other challenges. I'm not so sure about these, though. Maybe some sort of temple? New mobs? Something spooky? Like I said, I'm not sure about those.

It's an odd suggestion, I know. But it would be cool."
3593,"Hi there, I'm a recent graduate from UT. While pursuing my degree, I took a documentary filmmaking class and made a documentary about refugees in the Chattanooga area, entitled [If There Is A Way](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgtLdzSJy8s). It was a life-changing experience, and I'd love to work with films more, specifically in the area of editing.

However, I have no equipment, and a very limited budget. BUT, I still have my skills! So I'd like to offer my services to any local filmmakers/companies in need of help, specifically with editing, for free! Any opportunity to be part of the filmmaking experience again would be wonderful!

Please let me know if you or anyone you know is interested. Thank you"

3604,"I'm proud of me. I know that this isn't a big accomplishment by /r/sex's standards,  but: I finally helped my SO achieve orgasm. She is with the large percentage of women who can't orgasm vaginally, and can only do so clitoraly. Consequentially, she generally uses her vibrator to masturbate.

I was the first guy she ever pulled the vibrator out with, and a few months ago she managed to finish in the presence of another person-- a first! Tonight I went down on her, put a few fingers in, and then used her vibrator on her at her request. I got her within an inch of the orgasm-- so damned close-- but couldn't quite get her over (did my best to keep the vibrator in place and keep the pace of my fingers steady the whole time, but to no avail).

She took over the vibrator, but I left my fingers in and helped out as best I could. A few minutes (and a pair of moisture-pruned fingers) later, she finally came. It's not solely my actions that got her off, but I played a roll in it, and I'm damned proud of myself for that. We're not to the point where I can make her cum all by myself, but we're getting closer and closer each time!"

I've been depressed for years now, and only found this today and am so happy that there are others like me around the world.

It sounds so cliché that you're not alone, and I wouldn't have believed it myself if I hadn't experienced it for myself today.

So please, keep posting your thoughts and worries. Know that I am here to help you if needed and that there are others like me. "
3608,">Looking at how this message scandalized the ancient world opens a window into our preaching today. When the culture takes issue with the church today, it carps about our oppressive sexual ethics (especially our opposition to homosexual behavior) and our various prosperity gospels (from the most egregious health-and-wealth messages to the more subtle but equally dangerous sermons on how faith in Christ can improve your marriage, your business, and your self-esteem). And then there is the regular complaint about our self-righteousness—our incessant habit of pronouncing judgment on our culture, which is grounded in the assumption that sinners are found mostly in that culture, outside the church walls. Thus all the sermons about how we need to reform and stand against the culture, as if the “we” is in no need of fundamental reform, or that the Lord does not have a controversy with his people.


>In the New Testament era, by contrast, the big problem was the scandal of the Cross. It’s not hard to see why. Among the many things the Cross says is this: We’re as dead as Jesus. He hangs there as the true human, the sign of all humanity, dead to the world, dead to the future, and especially dead to God, who it seems has forsaken us. The situation is so bad that only the sacrifice of Another—again Jesus, who hangs there as true God—can remedy it. For people like us, who imagine we’re not so much dead as suffering a cold, and that if we take our vitamin C and will ourselves out of bed, we can make a go of it—well, this verdict can sound unnerving. Worse, to be told we can do nothing to revive ourselves, that we are left completely at the mercy of this Other—well, this doesn’t sit well in any culture, let alone in a culture that prizes individual initiative and heroic effort.

3610,"Hello all, I just got finished rewatching Contact, and I was wondering if there was any scifi out there (books, movies, tv shows) that go into that part of the first contact story. Basically fiction that is based around the events after contact, or after the discovery of FTL. 

I know this is a big part of the Star Trek world, and I enjoy that aspect of it, as it balances conflict with other things. But I've seen all of those. Most of the movies turn the story of first contact into a war here on Earth, which I'm a little bored of as a narrative. I have high hopes for Interstellar, hopefully it will be cool. 

So any recommendations would be great! Sorry if he post description wasn't clear - let me know and I can edit it if needed. 

Edit: Thanks everyone so far for the recommendations. I am putting together a list and can't wait to dive into it!"

3614,"I'm a nursing student and we had to do a cultural sensitivity assignment and present it to the class.

I've done some very very basic research on Islam, and the person giving report was going against what I had researched. It seemed she was getting western perceptions confused with reality. However, I didn't want to challenge her because I am vary ignorant myself.

Some things they reported that sounded vary biased:

1. Women are the property of men in Islam. All decisions are made by the husband. If not married, a father or brother makes their decisions.

2. Islam endorses killing for Allah. All murder in the name of Allah is seen as justified.

3. Marriage is a social contract rather than an expression of a couple's lasting love for each other. Marriage is usually set up by the parents, with little input from the bride/groom.

4. Denouncing your belief in Allah/Muhammad/Quran is grounds for execution.

This is small town Missouri and only have one non-white person in our class of 36, so the preconceived notions aren't surprising."

3625,"My name is Branden, I'm 20 as of December of last year.
At the age of 16, I moved to Washington state.
But it wasn't a planned decision at all...

I was born in Dallas, TX.
Raised by my mom. My dad was in and out of prison my whole life.
Early on i had a normal life like anybody else, But once in 1st grade, Everything went down hill. I was forced to switch schools because my mom and i didn't live in the district for the school i was going to.
I lived in a rough part of town, So i ended up in much different environment than before. I was one of two white kids in an all black/hispanic school. Ironically, At least to me, Being a white kid from the south, My whole class including my teacher were racist.

I've always had anxiety for as long as i can remember, And i hated change. Any change. I once cried over my mom getting new furniture.
So you can imagine that not only changing schools completely, But being around new people with much different attitudes was terrifying for me. I first realized that my peers were racist when no one would talk to me, And even made fun of me just for being white. I remember trying to play with one group of kids and once i walked up to them they all stopped talking and glared at me. Once i spoke, Asking to join in on their group activity, They said no. Not only that, They told me my hair was too long, And i was too white. Then told me to go away. I told my mom about this at lunch, (She would come have lunch with me everyday.) and she just simply told me it was kid stuff, And i just need to keep trying and give it time. So i just brushed it off. But it only got worse from there. Having anxiety, I was constantly worried i was going to mess up or do something wrong, So within the first couple of days i asked my teacher if i had a locker, Because i didn't want to leave my things laying around. All she did was yell at me. And told me ""You don't worry about that! If your things are in the way i'll throw them in the hall!"" Or something along those lines. Another time i was worried i wouldn't be able to read our class work for the day and asked for help ""If you can't read, Maybe you shouldn't even be here!"" And it only got worse from there.

After about a month, I was crying by lunch time and begging my mom to take me home with her. Finally, She did. For good. She told me i could be home schooled. First at static about the idea of just being out of that school and with my mom, I was super happy. But i had no idea it would probably be the worst decision of my life...

After a while, I was basically teaching myself. I had no one by my side telling me wrong from right or helping me to read or write. Just me, And the old Jump Start! programs. Eventually, After not feeling like i was getting anywhere, I begged my mom to let me stop and she did. She told me she would find a tutor to teach me at home, But being as broke as we were, That never happened. I didn't care at the time. Hell, 8 years old and all the time in the world to play games and have fun. 

At an early age, I realized my mom had a drug problem. If not from my own suspicion then from the police coming to my house multiple times in 1 year. Along with tons of her friends coming and going at all hours of the night. Being so young i just never cared. All i wanted was to play and have fun. But as i got older, It became more serious. At age 14, Still not in school, i was put in handcuffs and held in a room with my mom and some of her friends while police raided our house. One of the police officers even took the time out to pull me into the kitchen and tell me my mother was a drug addict and i should be ashamed of her. (Thats the dallas police deportment for you.)  My mom was later arrested and put on probation for 5 years for a drug felony. I didn't care very much being by this time i had started playing an online game called World Of Warcraft. It was great, An online escape with adventures and lots of friends. I stayed on that game locked in my room for at least 20 hours a day. 

By 16, I had started talking to a girl i met on World Of Warcraft. She was 15 and lived very far from me. Washington state. She was very close to me, I told her everything. She was who i could talk to about all my problems and she could talk to me as well. After about a year of talking, We started discussing me flying up and getting to meet. Her parents were even okay with it. But mine were not. She told me i was crazy and i would end up dead or something. I think she just wanted to have me stuck in my room where she knew i would be so she didn't lose me. So.... Being 16, And in what i thought was love, I made it my mission to get to washington to see her. I sold everything i had and started saving. Eventually i had enough for a one way ticket to Seattle, WA. I started packing bags, I was ready.

The night before my flight, I snuck out and left. I made it to the DFW airport by morning and waiting for my flight. I made it! By that night, I was in Seattle. And the girl of my dreams was waiting for me in the parking lot with her mom. We all met up and went to their home from there. After a week or so they asked me when i needed to get back to the airport to catch my flight. After explaining that i didn't have a ticket or a way home i was told i could stay for as long as i needed to. By this time my mom obviously knew where i was and what i did. She was very mad but mostly worried about me. To this day, I don't know why she didn't call the police and report me as a run away. 

The girls parents were aware of my background, Or should i say, My moms. And i think thats why they let me stay, But after a month they told me that if i wanted to, I could stay and live with them. Of course i jumped at the chance. The only exception was that i had to go to school. As you can probably imagine, I was pretty scared. Having not been in school sense i was 7. Luckily for me, Because of my online game addiction, I could read very well and later found out i had college level reading comprehension skill. 

As time went on, I did pretty okay in school. I had some friends and things were good. But some things changed for the bad, The girl i loved started to hate me. Maybe it was being around me too much, Maybe she just changed. I don't know. But after 1 year, She dumped me. As you can probably imagine, I was very hurt, And things were awkward around the house. So at 18, I left. And moved in with some friends.

Being 18, And only in high school, All i could do to pay my new roommates rent was give them my food stamps. That was fine with them, For a while. After 1 year of high school i had only managed to make 4 credits. Slow pace, But i would keep going for it. By 19 i had only made it to 8 and a half credits, Not only that, But i was highly lacking in math skills. Not only that, My roommates at the time were getting tired of no rent on my part. So i started looking for a job.

I live in a very small town outside of Olympia washington. Its a logging town. And there are next to no jobs here. I found this out after searching for 3 months. In those 3 months, Me and my roommates had a pretty bad argument that resulted in me moving out. Not knowing what to do, I did the only thing i could think of. I called one of my good friends and told her my situation. She helped me and now i live with her boyfriend who i am also friends with, In his parents house with her. Soon after found a local program called ""Host"" that pays students that don't live at home $50 a month to be involved in some kind of schooling, And the people you live with $100 a month to help pay for expenses. I also give them my food stamps.

Not far after this school year started, I dropped out to get my GED.
i'm 20 now and need a job to pay for myself around here, As well as get me out of here and on my own. Luckily i have found a program that i'm in now called ""Gravity"". They see what you need to learn and help you do so, As well as pay for you to take the GED test. It also works with the Host program so i can still give my friends the extra $100.

I guess i'm posting all of this for multiple reasons.
For advice, To vent, Maybe someone will see this and can relate.

I don't know if i made the right decision by leaving school, I just didn't have the time to go anymore if i'm trying to find a job. And the school was doing nothing to help me with my math problems. I really hate where i am right now, 20 year old high school drop out with nothing. I'm starting to realize that i don't even know how to get a job. I've only had one when i was 17 and i had to quit it. I don't know how to make a resume. I don't know how to make my self appear better than the competition, I don't know what to do with myself. I feel like i fail at every attempt i make. I've gotten my self 5 interviews in the last couple months, But alas i wasn't good enough. I'm so tired of this, I'm tired of depending on people. I've asked for help in life so much and i hate it. I just wish i could get somewhere good in life, And do it on my own. I wish i was a respectable person. I wish i could accomplish something. I wish i just knew how...

                         much. Its a great (and rare) opportunity to speak directly to the people who are listening to and 
                         enjoying the music that i write. Reddit is a great thing.

3638,"I was almost halfway through my hour on the elliptical today when you came in.  You looked lost and scared.  I wanted, desperately, to say something to you, but I didn't want to make you any more uncomfortable than you already were.  I want you to know that you inspired me.  You touched everything.  You looked around, maybe trying to find a machine that you thought you could handle.  I know that today, you did the best you could.  Maybe tomorrow, you'll get on that bike you were gazing at.  You can do it!

Is there a way to politely engage this girl, and others like her, in conversation?  I felt awful for her.  The only reason she stuck out to me at all was because all of her movements were either directly in front of me, or squarely in my periphery and grabbing my attention.  She reminded me a lot of me, back in elementary school, and her eyes were like... devastatingly sad.  But like I said, I didn't want to make her uncomfortable.  I imagine it probably took her days, if not weeks, just to build herself up enough to even walk in the door.  For some reason though, it's bothering me that I didn't even say hello.  I guess I'm just not familiar enough with the proper ettiquette, nor am I really very comfortable with my own self being there yet, to be engaging total strangers.  Thoughts?"

3644,I recently have finished watching the show Spaced on netflix. I actually watched it because a suggestion from reddit.  I have found that some of the best comedies on netflix are the random ones I watch for no real reason. Though these are seemingly few and far between. So I come back to reddit to see if I can find any new shows from other redditors.

3652,"I'm gonna sound like an old geezer, but I can remember when there were less than 2k fapstronauts here and you would see a 90 day report maybe once every other week. Now they are so common I almost thought about not posting mine (and don't get me wrong, I think it's phenomenal that there are so many now) but I made a promise to myself when I started this thing that I would post my story when I made it so here we go.

To say I had a problem with porn might be an understatement. Let me walk you through an average day before I found nofap, and I stress average. My alarm would go off to wake me up for work and I'd grab my phone to turn it off. Then I'd lay in bed for 20-30 minutes while surfing porn on my phone before I'd finally get up. If I wasn't running late I'd probably then jump on my computer for another 20-30 minutes of porn before heading out. At work I'd usually take a porn break on my phone in the bathroom stall or on the benches out front to break up the day. Then I'd head back home. I live with my girlfriend and she works earlier in the day than me so I'd wait for her to go to bed and then it would be more porn until I fell asleep. If she was out running errands I'd probably be home with porn. If she was out of town for a few days that meant it was time for a non-stop porn fest.

You know what the saddest thing about all this was? If you had asked me at the time if I had a problem with porn I would have laughed. I would have told you that porn was just something I used occasionally like any other normal guy. I was that blind to my problem. Well luckily a day came when I could no longer ignore it. I happened to see a link to r/nofap from another subreddit and came here for the first time thinking I was just gonna see what ""those"" people were all about. Well I was about to find out that I *was* one of ""those"" people. I clicked the link to Your Brain On Porn and started reading and it was like an atomic bomb went off in my head. I couldn't hide from it anymore. It put together so many pieces that I thought were unrelated. I finally accepted that I had a problem. I didn't waste any time. I decided to give up PMO that very day.

My first attempt was a true struggle, but it was also wonderfully enlightening. Finally free from the grasp of porn I began to reflect on things objectively. I started to see my habits as they really were. The sites I frequented most were ones with user contributed content meaning that there was always an endless supply of porn. Every time I went there it would have something new and exciting waiting for me. My collection was ridiculous. Not in size (though it was a solid 200GB) but in detail. I was so meticulous. Every single file in a collection of thousands was properly named and organized into a folder according to its attributes. I don't even want to think about how much time I wasted on this. Of course I never actually *looked* at the porn in my collection. That wasn't the point. I always wanted to go out and find new porn to add to my collection. My fetishes of course gradually became more extreme. I'm honestly too embarrassed to even get in to it - even to anonymous strangers who would understand. 

There was one last significant thing I had to confront. I had been with my girlfriend for a long time and I loved her, but we were slowly developing a rift between us and I didn't want to face it. Porn gave me a way out. When I was looking at porn I felt happy. I didn't have to think about my relationship problems and I could just pretend they didn't exist. This was the single greatest gift nofap gave me. It forced me to confront these problems with her and we were able to work through them. I can say without a doubt that our relationship is better now than it has ever been.

My first try I made it 44 agonizing days before I broke down, but immediately picked myself back up with another 40. This was the point where I really reconciled with my girlfriend and I made the massive mistake of thinking I was cured, so I thought what would a little porn hurt? So I relapsed, and I relapsed hard. It took all of 48 hours to go from vanilla to the extremest of the extremes. Alcoholics never just have one drink. Porn addicts never just look at a little porn.

From here it was just a long series of relapses. One month on porn, one month on nofap, rinse and repeat. The truth was I was never really committed to any of these attempts. I just did them out of a sense of obligation. Then one day it hit me. It had been exactly 1 year since my very first attempt. I set my resolve that nothing would stop me this time, and here I am 90 days later.

So how have I changed? I don't hide from my problems anymore. I don't pretend they don't exist. I accept them for what they are and I find the willpower to overcome them. I fight to live the life I want to live. I've watched my fetishes deconstruct and I see them for the absurdities that they are. I have a better understanding of who I am.

If you want a moral to take away from this or a TL;DR, it's this: nofap is about self control, self reflection, and self improvement. It's a war you fight every day of your life, but one in which every victory adds momentum to the next. Never give up.

And finally, much thanks to this community. I owe you all so much."

3654,"I've been really lucky and I'm almost at the end of my weight loss journey. 

I'm currently struggling with how to communicate with my overweight/obese friends. An old friend (she and I used to talk about being overweight) recently got engaged, and I was just shocked at some of the photos and how huge she is. It's at a point where there's no way it's not affecting her health.

The inevitable ""She knows she's fat"" comments aside, I just wish there wasn't a taboo about me talking to her about it. I wish I had the freedom to just talk to her and be like, you're huge and its sad and I'm seriously worried about your health, but mostly I want you to know that you can change and be healthier and lose weight and I did it and I can help you.

Having said all that, I still have mixed feelings about actually doing the magic. I have zero belief and even some strong feelings of anger about the whole thing. I'm dreading the deed.

3659,"**EDIT:** Thanks for all the love and support everyone!  You've all helped me stay on track and be motivated to succeed - and I hope I've done the same for at least one person.  I decided to also tell my brother last night.  He came over, we had a beer, and I had him read the exact same email.  Now I have a team around me, and we're going to do a lot of things (internet filter, weekly checkins, more connections, volunteer work, possibly seeing a professional) to make sure I can overcome this.  We decided to let it soak in for the newcomers, and we're all going to sit down next week and make a plan.  I'm open to helping anybody on here via PM, so please let me know if I can help you.  And I'll try to reply to everyone, but thankfully I have a busy day on not touching my dick ahead of me!  Keep kicking ass everyone!

------------------

As you can see by my flair, I'm only on my second day.  After emailing with my mom earlier today, she said that she found of box of my old stuff and said: ""I am going to bring you the file as well because, my son, you were quite the stud in your young life.  So very many accolades.  Somewhere along the way, you seemed to quit believing in yourself.  I think it would be good for you to go through this file and see what you were and still are capable of.""

I replied that I already knew I was a failure, and then got into a bit of a pity party, telling her that I wished I could tell her the truth, but I just couldn't, and it would break her heart.  Of course, she's a mom, so she said I could tell her anything.  I decided to honey badger this shit and just lay it on her.  So I wrote a long email, and then texted her to get Dad and go read it in their bedroom (relatives live with them, don't want them involved).  In the hope that I can inspire other fapstronauts to get over their fear of involving loved ones in this transformation, I'm pasting the letter below (with redactions/changes for privacy)(also, my family isn't shy with the cussing, as you will see)**:**

-----------------------

What changed?  It wasn't really ""an event"", but a series of things.  You want to know, so I'll tell you, but I'd recommend that you are sitting down when you read this, because it's gonna hurt.

So I was much like most teenagers.  When it came to sex though, I was very naive and unprepared.  But since I was smart and good with computers, I found out a lot about sex from the internet.  I know you know that with how many times you caught me with porn.  Now, without grossing my out too much, I'm sure you've seen porn before.  Porn is not sex.  But it is a sex substitute.  I was quickly able to get a hold of a lot of porn.  Teenagers are horny, they masturbate a lot, and in these days, they watch porn.  So what?

Well, I lost my virginity at 16.  It was less exciting than I wanted it to be.  It felt good and all, but it wasn't porn.  It was quick, awkward, and then felt extremely weird afterward.  I'm sure you're familiar with the limited talks I had with you guys about sex - ""Wear a rubber"" was about the only advice Dad had for me.  Thankfully, I did follow that.

So I had sex a couple times, and then not for awhile.  In between, I watched plenty of porn.

The next time I tried to have sex (at 17 years old), I couldn't keep an erection.  Yes, ""this happens to all guys"", but holy shit was that a confidence killer.  The girl was really hot, I really liked her, there was no reason for things not to work.  But I wasn't really turned on.  It was sort of meh.  So that sucked, but I didn't give up.  I tried again - fail.  I tried again - fail.  I never tried again until college, because I thought college would solve my problems.  It didn't.

I met some girls at college.  Went on some dates.  Tried sex a couple of times - it didn't work.  So I retreated.  You know when I could keep an erection?   Watching porn.  So I went deep down the rabbit hole, and developed the horrible habits that I'm still trying to kick to this day.  Everyone masturbates from time to time, but I started masturbating 2, 3, 4 times/day.  Why do you think I dropped out of college?  You didn't honestly think it was just drugs and alcohol, did you?  I could skate through classes like it was nobodies business.  But I started staying home from class because my roommate was gone then, so I could watch porn.  It became what I did to pass time, when I was nervous, when I was tired, when I was anxious, when I was excited, when I had something to do, when I had nothing to do...

Remember that girl **** that I dated?  Why do you think we broke up?  Ugh, this is so awkward to be writing to my mom, but let me tell you something: there is no worse feeling than not being able to get an erection with a girl you are into.  She couldn't understand that it wasn't her.  And girls want to have sex - she was a cute girl, and wasn't going to wait around for a guy that couldn't get his dick to work properly.  That was pretty much the final shot for me.  I gave up.

Do you have any idea what life is like if you know (I know that's wrong, but its how I felt at the time) that you'll never pleasure a partner?  I wanted to get married and have kids, build a family, travel the world, have fun, and share it with a significan other.  Well, all of that was out the window.  I had no prospects for my future.  I tried to fill the void - I thought I could work myself through it, that didn't help.  I thought I could drug myself through it, that didn't help.  I thought setting big external goals like going to law school would help, it didn't.  By the time I graduated college, I was miserable.  I was working a shit job only because my mom had got it for me, I had a shit degree from a shit college that I wasn't going to do shit with.  None of my strategies had helped.  I couldn't care about a life where I wasn't ever going to be able to pleasure a woman.  I kept working at the law firm because fuck it, who cares?

At this point, I was still masturbating 2-6 times/day (I'm so sorry to gross you out).  Why did I quit the law firm?  Another strategy to try to get rid of this!  I thought that once I was in control of my life, I could kick the habit.  As I'm sure you can guess, that didn't happen.  Working from home only made it easier.  And with all the self doubt I had from this shit, I just kept feeding it.  Even when I was completely in control of my own life, I'd just waste the entire day in bed, hating myself, hating my life, hating what I had come to.  I made enough money to get by, but just barely.

Now, I'm at damn near rock bottom.  I have tens of thousands of dollars of credit card debt and nothing to show for it.  I haven't paid my student loans in a year - they are going to collections.  I own nothing, I have no plans for the future.  What's the point?  I can't ever have what I want.  I don't think you can possibly understand how bleak life is when you know you can never have what you want.

Somehow though, I haven't given up yet.  My back is against the wall.  I'm going to miss my credit card payments in a week, and then I really don't know what I'm going to do.  And it's not because I can't make money - I have people begging me to do work for them.  But whats the point of getting out of bed if you know that your whole day is just going to be spent hating yourself?  Some days I just wouldn't get out of bed at all, literally.  I'd cycle through porn and masturbation, smoking weed and browsing the internet, and crying myself back to sleep.  EVERYTHING in my life is because of this.

It's why I don't do anything with my life.  It's why I don't do stand up comedy, even though I'd be amazing at it.  It's why I never owned my own restaurant, even though it was a dream of mine and I'd kill it.  It's why I didn't go to law school.  WHAT IS THE POINT OF ANY OF THAT IF YOU WILL NEVER HAVE WHAT YOU WANT IN LIFE?  Why should I get up on stage and make girls laugh if I can't take any of them home with me?  Or worse - take them home and ruin the night because I can't get it up.  There are only so many times that a guy can see the ""What do you mean you can't get it up?"" face.  And unfortunately, I'm just not evil enough to only want money in life.  What's the point of having money if you can't spend it on taking a beautiful girl out to dinner because you know you can't take her home later?  You know why I quit playing soccer?  That abdominal pain I have? Its from ruining my pelvic muscles with constant masturbation.  I'm ruining myself, body and mind.

But, like I said, I haven't given up.  In fact, in the last year, I've discovered that I'm not alone, not at all - thousands of young men from all walks of life are currently in the same prison.  I really didn't think anyone else could possibly live this life and not kill themselves.  It's so horrible.  It's not a regular addiction like cigarettes or booze or drugs.  It's not something I can announce on facebook: ""Two days without porn everyone! Yay me!""  It's a prison that no one can see.  And, worst of all, it is completely free.  I don't have to rob or steal to get my fix, I just have to keep paying my comcast bill.  Speaking of that, some of my money problems do stem from porn - I was sued for illegally downloading movies.  I went to a lawyer, and he recommended that I just settle, even though I could probably beat it, but it would be long and public.  So I settled for $3500 that I didn't have.  Ugh.

But like I said, I haven't given up.  I'm trying to kick this horrible situation.  I don't know right now if you understand how grave this situation is for me, or if you think it's all a joke.  So here are a couple of links that might help:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSF82AwSDiU - The Great Porn Experiment - a TED talk by the leading researcher on this stuff.

www.yourbrainonporn.com - Information, resources, and support for people in my situation.

www.reddit.com/r/nofap - Where I'm going for support to try to get out of this.  It's semi-anonymous which helps me be open.

Most people that have successfully beat this problem go through the following phases: The tough initial stage (1-7 days), a clarity phase (8-30 days, give or take), a flat-line where you have 0 libido (at any time, usually only lasts a couple of weeks), and then it gets better, the libido comes charging back, the ED is gone, and sex is pleasurable again.  They advocate a no-PMO lifestyle (no Porn, Masturbation, or Orgasm).  This is only until you have rewired your brain to enjoy natural sex and respond to it appropriately.  Masturbation is not the demon, its the way we masturbate to modern pornography that makes the difference (pay attention to the part of the youtube clip where he shows that older people recover faster than younger people, because their problems didn't develop UNTIL they got high speed internet whereas the younger generation has always had it).

I've tried to quit this horrible, degrading, demotivating lifestyle multiple times.  I don't know if you've ever noticed, but whenever we go on family vacation, I'm usually pretty miserable on days 2-4.  Those are the days that I'm adjusting to not getting my fix.  I usually want to kill somebody when I wake up, but as the day goes along, and if we stay busy enough, I get through it.  But as soon as I get back home, it's right back to where I left off.

I've thought about asking my brothers for help, but I don't think they would understand.  I've sort of told ****** about some of it (gee - why do you think ****** and I have never got together?).  Hell, there was a point when I thought maybe I was just gay and I wasn't getting it, as I know others have speculated.  Well, I tried it out once, it didn't do it for me.  I told dad once that I was having erection problems, and he told me to go to the doctor.  I did, and he told me its nothing physical (I knew that, because I could easily get an erection with porn).  I even went to a psychologist for a bit, but that shit is mega expensive, and it seemed like I knew as much as he did (why do you think I took psychology classes in college?).

So there it is Ma.  That is what happened to me.  I don't think you can possibly comprehend the look on a girls face when she's begging you to fuck her and all you can say is ""I can't right now.""  I don't think you have any idea what it feels like to expect your life to be unfulfilling forever.  It's extremely hard to pursue your goals if you know you'll never be able to share them with anybody.  And please don't tell me that if I found the right girl, it wouldn't matter.  It DOES matter.  It's huge.  Women deserve a man that can love them, and they know that.  I wouldn't want any woman to be in a relationship with a guy that couldn't please her.  I've tried all sorts of relationships - with good girls, with bad girls, with girls I love, with girls I don't care about, even some morally unpopular choices - I was doing anything I could try to get a response.  But none of it mattered, and I'd just come home to watch more porn.

I know I've been a disappointment.  I don't want to be.  I want to change.  I'm trying, very hard.  And well, now that you know what the fuck my problem has been, now I'm asking for help.  Nothing specific, I don't even know how you possibly could help, but there will likely be a time in the next couple of months (if I stick with it), where I'm going to need help.

I can't wait to get past this.  I know I'm more than the person I have become.  I'm sooooo much more.  But I can't be that while I'm trapped in this self-imposed prison.  You're right - I want to fly.  But I'm a bird in a cage.  I'm trying to pry the fucking door open with one hand, while my other hand holds it closed.  If I can ever get out of here, watch out world.

You don't need to write back.  We can talk about this when we have lunch.  I don't know how I'm going to be able to look you in the eye at dinner Friday night.  But you wanted to know, and I know I need to tell you, so there it is.  I want to assure you that drugs and alcohol haven't ever been my problem.  Sure, like to drink and smoke pot, but so does everyone.  I don't even do either of those very much anymore.  My problem has always been the PMO addiction cycle.  Please watch the video so you can understand how hard this cycle is to break.

Yesterday, I committed myself to trying again.  I have to keep trying.  I'm the only person that put myself in this situation, so I'm the person that is going to get me out of it.  I can, and I will, I just have to stick with it.

Love you."
3660,"I lost 80 pounds in 8 months. I lost it by downloading the lose it app on my phone and counting all the calories that I ate. It was really hard at first, I'm not going to lie. I was addicted to food. I would eat when I wasn't hungry and sometimes eat two dinners a night. It wasn't good food for you either,like pizza. I finally decided I didn't want to be overweight anymore so I changed my diet and got motivated to go to the gym everyday. I would do cardio anywhere from thirty minutes to an hour each day. I recently got a personal trainer who is now helping me with weights. I feel a lot healthier and happier with my new life now and hopefully can keep it off.

When I think of loved ones being treated poorly, it makes me sad I want them to love themselves and stand up for themselves.  So doesn't that mean I should do the same thing?

The jist of mine was I didn't ever want to be caught going into a major just because there is money in that major simply because that's not necessarily something I'm looking for. I wanted to go to college because of the old way of thinking is: I'm going to college to learn.

3680,"So my wife and I plan on moving to the cliff in the next few months, and we're working on narrowing down the specific neighborhood we want to target.  Kiddo will be 3 in October.

Home budget is around 250k

at that budget we're pretty much priced out of kessler and winnetka heights, and consequently we're priced out of rosemont, which is a bummer but that is what it is.

The alternatives seem to be winnetka, salazar, peabody, hogg, and brashear, with all of the other starting to *really* fall off from there.  We also like the idea of Greiner middle school for the arts magnet program.  This is all kind of from afar, as we've lived in uptown for the last 13 years with no kiddos.

From afar, i think i like winnetka and brashear the best, but i could be totally off base.

So the question is:

Do any of you have any experience with any of the above schools?  Are there any options that we're missing?  Should we *avoid* any of the above listed schools for any reason?"

También, estaría bueno que luego de comentar lo que les gusta, todos pongan 1 ó 2 canciones de alguna banda que estén escuchando en este momento, y de a poco conversar sobre gustos y poquito a poco, empezar a llenar el otro subreddit dedicado a la música con, uh... música. :P

Ok, empiezo yo. Soy bastante abierto musicalmente, no tengo un género predilecto... o mejor dicho, sí, el metal pesado y todos sus subgéneros. Pero no siempre estoy limando con Metal a fondo en mi MP3, por ahí paso de [Metal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEVodXzNmPM) (cualquier subgénero que me plazca en ese momento) a [Trip-Hop](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmWGaKgXnHM), y luego paso por [DnB](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILRnXkC8SRM) (Drum and Bass; este útimo lo estoy explorando hace poquito), después por [Stoner](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVm8G0ipETc), y más tarde tal vez por [alguna canción pop setentosa u ochentosa](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhsTmiK7Q2M) (esto se me pegó en parte por las bandas sonoras de Tarantino y por jugar tanto al GTA y sus estaciones de radio geniales)... y termino con [Noise](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBR1OE3e60c) (este último depende más de mi estado de ánimo, no es algo que podría escuchar constantemente).

Reconozco que, como la mayoría de los flacos que crecieron en los '90s como yo, la apertura de bocho musical mayormente me la dio MTV, al rotar [Metallica](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-Bn_kD6QN4), después [Alice in Chains](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JA25BIxgtk), después [Garbage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfAcI1bx72I)... y después [Manson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKrupTh_L80), todo en 1 hora. Doy gracias de haber adquirido gustos tan variados y no ser tan cabeza de termo como algunas otras personas que conozco.

Like such an event can only be explained by at-length monologues on physics. Contrast this to Siri or Lenie Clarke in Watts' works and you'll see what I mean. Perhaps it is by design in an attempt to [Spoiler](/s ""create the feel of the Polis' post Introdus""). In either case, it did not work for me.

One of the best docs i have seen in a very long time. If you think this movie is just about sushi you are going into this movie wrong, at first i was a little weary about watching it because I was thinking. what can a movie about sushi teach me or how can it keep me entertained. But this movie teaches more than how to run a sushi place, it tells you how to live your life really. If you like something become the master at it, become the best in your field. This man become the master in sushi and was able to create a Legacy  off a 10 seat restaurant. It also passes off the message that we are ruining the fish world by over fishing, and that if you can get sushi at a 7-11 then we will run out of fish soon.

For me, the characters in *The Uplift War* are better written than in *Startide Rising*.

The focus on the Gubru in the **Galactics** section actually gives the reader time to understand the alien culture, in contrast to the disparate flashes of aliens in *Startide Rising* that distracted from the story.

But the end of *Startide Rising* is incredible in its chaotic finale (as war should be), whereas *The Uplift War* fizzles out in an overly long series of well-timed coincidences (complete with a Star Wars medallion ceremony).

I got down to 155 pounds in about 8 months, but I was still wearing a 10 (sometimes 12) because I wasn't really all that toned. You know the story, I got a boyfriend, I stopped trying. I crawled back up to 165 by the end of our relationship, wearing a size 12. In late 2011, I got a fire up my ass and decided that enough was enough; I *was* going to be hott again!

3739,"Hi guys,

I read an article about habits. And there it dawned to me: PMO isn't only an addiction, it's a habit as well! And therefore we have another way how to work on that problem - and get a solution for the very long run.

We can get rid of PMOing, getting rebooted and then, what's about the ""afterlife""? Have we changed for good? Or others can't just get rid of it in the first weeks. 

The AA see their addiction as a habit (I never knew that before). So the approch is quite simple: You exchange your addiction habit with another, valuable habit.

For this you have to observe yourself and to find out: 

[b]1. What is (or what was) the time in day for your bad habit?[/b] When did you do it?

[b]2. What is or was the trigger to do your habit?[/b] Not only sexy pics are triggers - any uncomfortable situation, frustration with your spouse, not getting the sex you wanted, feeling lonely, or doing yourself something good before starting a work. What you did, you gave yourself a hormone (dopamin) rush to make you feel better. Or more relaxed. Or sleepy.(But only for short).

[b]3. What could be a good habit to replace that old habit with?[/b]
That's a good question, even for me. I think I replaced it partly with writing here in that forum. Writing three hours per day and helping others is better than three hours of wanking, using erotic images to get the lame Johnson working, isn't it? 

But it's good in the beginning to have that forum, because it deals already with that topic. So it could be used like that: In any circumstance when I used to PMO in former times, I will go to a forum and do some work there. (Remember: On Reddit/nofap there are a lot of posts unanswered. But even here on reuniting some help or contact is needed).

In the long run we need other habits to replace that even.

One question in replacing an old habit is also: [b]What makes me feel good?[/b] I means [b]really [/b]feel good. Other hormone surges like sugary diet, caffein, alcohol, telenovelas and other such consuming habits are bad exchanges.

What really helps is, when you achieve something - even if you have to fight for it in the beginning. Call a friend, write a letter, massage your partner or a familiy member, tidy something in your room or your house (a shelf, a drawer, a corner, etc), make a (small) donation - that makes one feel very good...

I suggest to write it down, here in the forum (or in your signature) or on the wall or somewhere. Tell it somebody and make yourself accountable...

So I ask you to write down here, what you will do or what others could do as a habit instead of PMO."
3740,Title says it all. I want to make some posters. What should I write on them? Bonus points for math relevance. Thanks! 
3741,"But for the first time in I can't remember how long, none of these thoughts have made me miserable, hopeless, or full of dread and despair. A few of them have even brought a smile to my face.

I'm certainly not back to normal or anything. But thinking about where I am now to where I was just a few simple months ago seems to be a million miles behind me. And I need to keep reminding myself of that. Because who knows how much better I'll be just a few more months from now as well.

This stuff *can* get better everybody. Just remember it's not a one big leap process. It's just taking a few (sometimes scary) steps at a time. "

3746,"We all love Bungie. Most of the people here are on /r/halo as well, me included, and some of us liked Bungie before Halo. Specifically, I enjoyed Marathon. I love Halo and Marathon because they are fun and somewhat casual, at least less casual than RPG's, but there was something else that I couldn't pinpoint until recently. Bungie games are just...something else for some reason, and you want to learn more about them, as evident by the success of the Halo books and Halo lore. Then it hit me. Bungie games are mysterious. In Marathon, you only learn about the story line through consoles scattered throughout the game, and even then it's just a grasp of the story. In Halo, the story is pretty straightforward, but there is *so much room for postulation as to different things that aren't revealed directly.* For example, the Forerunners. The atmosphere in the games, particularly Halo, is one of awe and mystique (this is hugely due to music in my opinion). Since Destiny has had almost no information leaked and Bungie has been leading up to something on their twitter, I assume Destiny will be as mysterious, and as such as good, as the other Bungie games. I know this post is only weakly related to Destiny, but I wanted to put it here because you guys are Bungie fans as well as Destiny fans.

**TL;DR: If Bungie keeps the same formula for Destiny as they have for previous games, which I think they will, it will be amazing. This formula is one in which there is an atmosphere of awe and mystique, as well as good music and amazing structures.**

Side note: can I x-post this to /r/halo?"
3747,"A little bit about myself: I am an 18 year old male attending community collage.  I started PMO when I was 11 years old.  

Looking back on it all, I was addicted from the start, but I did not come to realize my problem until a few years after I started PMO.  Around age 13 my dad found out that I was watching porn, and he tried to help me stop the only way he knew how, by putting content blockers on our computers at home.  I love my father, and he has been a huge help in my life, but how naive he was to think a porn blocker could keep me out!  I won't go into details about how I did it, but circumventing the software was pathetically simple.  

After that my dad never found out about the porn again, and life went back to ""normal"", but there is a catch.  As we all know here at /r/nofap (and /r/pornfree) addictions grow.  By the time I was 15 I'd become a depressed, self-loathing, and hateful individual.  What the next two paragraphs have to say is horrible, and I will carry the weight of these memories to my grave.  

I hated who I was.  I hated that I could not gather enough courage and strength to stop my PMO addiction.  I tried to stop more times than I can remember,  perhaps more than 50 times I tried.  The longest time between relapses was one week.  During this stretch I thought I might have been able to beat the PMO, but I broke down on day 8 and binged until my penis was bloody.  This is who I was.  On top of the addiction I became extremely physically sick.  At one point I had to receive multiple emergency blood infusions to keep my heart from stopping.  

I was a wreck in every way.  And I helped kill one of the only friends I ever had.  This friend came to me asking for help, I knew he suffered from extreme depression, and he needed someone to talk to, but I told him that life is shit and nothing matters.  He ran his car off the freeway later that night, a clean cut vehicular suicide.  The next day when I talked to his girlfriend she told me what had happened, and I laughed.  I laughed when I learned that one of my only friends in the world killed himself.  

It is impossible for me to put into words how disgusted I am with who I was.  The old me was a monster.  I am honestly surprised I never raped or sexually assaulted anyone.  The only thing holding me back was shame.  The one thing I held onto was my desire to please my dad.  I did not want him to know who I was on the inside.  I went to church every Sunday and Wednesday, I talked the christian talk and acted like I was fine.  I became an amazing liar.  I could get anything past almost anyone.  During church I would sit and look at all the hot high-school girls around me.  I would sit there hiding my erection as I fantasized about these girls.  

This hell lasted for a few years until one day I decided to kill myself.  I knew I was sick in the head, but I did not want help, I wanted an end to the pain, shame, and total self hatred.  But I could not go through with it.  I could not even bring myself to end myself!  Do you have any idea what that's like?  Being so totally controlled by your own body that you can't not even destroy yourself?  And so at age 17 I allowed myself to be a slave to my body.  I created a schedule: 
Wake up, go to school, come home and watch porn for half an hour, do homework, eat dinner, play video games, watch porn until I got too tired to continue, go to sleep, repeat.  I became a robot.  Following the same schedule... day after day.

Well, something weird happened about 3 months ago.  Some random dude I had never met came up to me and changed my world.  He talked to me, made me feel like I had worth and he asked me questions.  Now,  to all the liars out there, you know that a question is very dangerous.  If you don't have the right tools in place and a proper cover story, a simple question can ruin everything.  Well, when A (my new friend) started to ask me questions... I felt too tired to come up with a good cover story.  So I told him the truth.  The next day, he introduced me to a friend of his, K.  Well, K is the most amazing girl I have ever met in my life.  In one moment I felt like something in my mind just snapped.  I knew that I wanted to date this girl, but I also knew who I was.  So I went to war.  I deleted all the porn off my computers, I got honest with a few fantastic older guys I know, and I removed every source of temptation from my life.  I decided for myself, for the first time in 7 years that I would do what ever it takes to make myself a better person.  The rest is history.  

After 90 days of absolutely zero porn of any kind (not even playing video games like skyrim), no masterbation, no edging, and nothing even remotely sexual in any way, I am a new person.  I have changed from the deepest part of my being.  Nothing is the same.  I used to lie to anyone and everyone about anything, now I can't get myself to say anything dishonest, even if I wanted to... I just cant.  Also, I have self confidence.  Prior to October of last year I had only one friend, and we rarely hung out.  Now, I have a core group of four friends who I would do anything for, and I am making new friends everywhere I go.  This sounds silly, but the world is a beautiful place!  I always walked around shoulders hunched and head down.  Now I make eye contact with everyone and maintain perfect posture.  I have girls telling me that I look good, and some people who knew the old me don't recognize who I am anymore.  One guy I have known for a few years had no idea it was me when we chatted yesterday!  I used to have horrible acne, no style, no personality, bad hair, and no ability to change who I was.  Now I look in the mirror and I like who I am.  I still need to gain a bunch of muscle mass, but other than that I am one sexy beast!  Finally, I have drive.  I will gain 25 pounds of muscle this year,  I will get good grades in school,  I will memorize a 1000 word poem by the end of next week.  Not because I need to (although the grades I kinda do need), but because I want to. 

So, moral of the story to all my brothers and sisters who take up the fight, if I can do it, you can do it.  Seriously, if the fucked up piece of shit that I used to be can change, you can do it too.  Now, the first thing you need to do if you want to start this journey is to get yourself a friend that you know you can trust, and lay your situation out to them.  YOU WILL NOT win this fight if you do it all on your own.

* Code that goes on rockets and spacecraft.
* Code that supports the design and manufacturing process of rockets and spacecraft.

We work on everything from large-scale web applications to tiny embedded computing platforms.  We build tech stacks on C#/MVC4/EF/MSSQL via REST to Javascript/Knockout/Handlebars/LESS, C++/Embedded Linux, Python, LabVIEW… which all together enables us to build, launch, and monitor stuff that goes to space.


**Some videos of our recent work:**

**Proof:**

http://imgur.com/bl8dlZ2

Edit: Poor Dan, everyone knows he was photo-shopped. Don't close your eyes next time! 

Edit 2 : We've been getting a lot of questions about how C#/MVC/etc have to do with rockets. They don't. At SpaceX we have 4 separate software teams:

1.  The Flight Software team is about 35 people.  We write all the code for Falcon 9, Grasshopper, and Dragon applications; and do the core platform work, also on those vehicles; we also write simulation software; test the flight code; write the communications and analysis software, deployed in our ground stations.  We also work in Mission Control to support active missions.

2. The Enterprise Information Systems team builds the internal software systems that makes spacex run. We wear many hats, but the flagship product we develop and release is an internal web application that nearly every person in the company uses. This includes the people that are creating purchase orders and filling our part inventory, engineers creating designs and work orders with those parts, technicians on the floor clocking in and seeing what today's work will be per those designs...and literally everything in between. There are commercially available products that do this but ours kicks major ass! SpaceX is transforming from a research and engineering company into a manufacturing one - which is critical to our success - and our team is on the forefront of making that happen. We leverage C#/MVC4/EF/SQL; Javascript/Knockout/Handlebars/LESS/etc and a super sexy REST API.

3. The Ground Software team is about 9 people. We primarily code in LabVIEW.  We develop the GUIs used in Mission and Launch control, for engineers and operators to monitor vehicle telemetry and command the rocket, spacecraft, and pad support equipment.  We are pushing high bandwidth data around a highly distributed system and implementing complex user interfaces with strict requirements to ensure operators can control and evaluate spacecraft in a timely manner.

4. The Avionics Test team works with the avionics hardware designers to write software for testing.  We catch problems with the hardware early; when it's time for integration and testing with flight software it better be a working unit.  The main objective is to write very comprehensive and robust software to be able to automate finding issues with the hardware at high volume.  The software usually runs during mechanical environmental tests.

Edit 3: Yes, we are doing a ton of hiring for these software positions that we have been talking about today. Interns and New Grads too! 

Edit 4: Thank you so much everyone! This is ending but most of the group will be back at 2:00pmPST to answer more questions. 

Edit 5: ...and we're back! Engineers from each of our engineering teams are present. Let us catch up a bit and start swering again (probably be about 5 minutes).

For all open software related positions, please go to http://www.spacex.com/software.php

**Edit 6: Thank you so much Reddit! This was a ton of fun. To all those asking about internships and employment, our suggestion is to apply online. Your resume will definitely get read. To all the students out there, GL with your midterms coming up and stick at it. Try and work on some side projects and get as much practical experience coding as possible before graduating. Happy Friday everyone!**

3757,"So this is a concept I have been throwing around for a while and I want to know if this is how you guys do things or not.

Now, I'm not talking two story lines in one book, I'm talking continuing your world with more stories. Creating new people, new countries, and new places but contained on the same world. You could have neat references to the past that the characters don't understand (like a museum with stuff that was the previous story's main character). Or you could have the events of one influence the other. Thoughts?

Dont worry - if you do feel like the guy is a loser or any such thing - just be honest! It would help me - and certainly other big people know how to react (or how to strengthen the mind) before running

Thanks guys for your opinions (and honesty!)

Are we going to make sure the remaining herbivorous species don't starve or overpopulate?  How far are we as humans going to take this philosophy?

Personally, I would say I am interested mainly in a world where **humans** live isolated from animals.  No eating them, no hurting, no exploiting, no pets, no zoos, etc.  Occasionally, animals would wander around and humans would be completely benign.  Not hurting them, but also not trying to house them or take them in.  Just neutral.

I feel a bit silly doing one of these since I'm pretty sure most of you guys know much more about the actual subject of weightlifting than I do. But it was suggested that I do an AMA for a bit of fun, so here I am!

I actually reached my goal right before Thanksgiving, but then promptly added some nice holiday weight on.  Nothing bad, just needed to spend a month getting back into shape.  I promised I would update when I accomplished this so here you go!  I decided to follow a dream of mine to become a professional sports team dancer this weekend!  Although I didn't quote make it, I did a damn good job of keeping up with girls 10 years younger than me who hadn't stopped dancing for nearly a decade!  I plan to keep auditioning and keep dancing, and I that would not have ever been an option for me if I hadn't changed my lifestyle, thanks to plenty of your inspiring stories!!

Thank you /r/loseit!!!

Edit:  I forgot to add my starting weight around 140, although I'm fairly certain it was closer to 150 at my heaviest.  Current weight, 110, although it fluctuates between 108-113.  I'm 5'1"". :)"

And there are many things lost due to just this single thing.  
No trust & respect development towards the teacher (which will also result in lack of depth). No seriousness of following the suggestion (someone else will give an answer where you wont have to struggle or just ignore and move on). No necessity for personal struggle and so on...

3825,"Hey guys,

Basically I'm a pretty slim dude (6'0 175 lbs) - I've been lifting for about 8 months and I've made good progress, but I still want to continue bulking. I'm still lifting heavy and eating high calorie meals. Being strong and big is still my top fitness goal.

But finals are coming up and I've been getting a bit overwhelmed with my studies and my mood and energy has overall declined. I feel irritable and tired and I lack the vibrance that I usually have. However, I hear that cardio can do wonders for your mental and emotional health.

So my dilemma is this: I'm strongly considering using cardio as a tool to improve my mood to improve my efficiency during study sessions, but I also want to continue bulking. 

Would starting up a light cardio routine damage my gains? Would I get skinnier? If so, what if I added more carbs to my diet?

Thanks in advance.

Edit: thanks for the advice guys :) Gonna go buy some cheap running shoes tomorrow and start some light jogging at the gym."

It has left a deep emotional effect on me, I cried when I was watching the end of the AS and I tear up thinking about it sometimes. [However, there is my problem. The anime spends 3-4 episodes focusing on the timeline where Nagisa dies, and then only 1 where she is alive. So, when I cast my thoughts back to the anime, I feel depressed and sad even though I should be happy that all three are living together as a happy family. I focus on the intense feeling of sadness of I felt when Nagisa and Ushio died and this makes me feel depressed, instead of the happiness I should be feeling.](/spoiler) Can someone suggest a method to focus more on the positives rather than the negatives?"

3852,"For the first time since I've been an Atheist I've encountered a situation in which my atheism has been blurred a bit. I've been an atheist for quite a while now, but only really educated myself fully on the subject for the past year and a half. I feel like I now know all the reason's that I'm an atheist are solid, and I'm sure that most readers here would share them. Anyways two days ago my Grandmother went into a coma. She has struggled with cancer for years, but over the past year or so she's been really affected by the chemo. Today with my Irish catholic family gathered around her hospital bed, my great uncle who is a catholic priest, read her, her last rights. This was such a hard experience for me. I have never before been confronted with a situation where my belief that heaven is a made up la la land,  directly come into play with my losing of some one close. I actually really wanted to believe that god and the angels and all my other dead relatives would be waiting for her on the other side. I really wanted to hold my family's hands and pray to an all powerful omnipotent creator. I really would have like to believe all the things that my family does, and not be the godless black sheep. The problem is my mind doesn't work that way. I didn't choose to find zero evidence of a god, I didn't choose to write the evil, unethical drool found throughout the bible, especially in that disgusting book deuteronomy. I just can't live a life based on bad evidence, I can't live a life based on a faulty dogma. I know that my grandmother is a beautiful person who had a amazing heart and mind. She will live on in the faces of her children, grandchildren and great grandchildren. Those she touched, and met will forever be affected by her. She was like my second mother, and I will love and miss her, but I will not compromise my own rational thoughts and beliefs, just because it would be easier for myfamily and myself if I did. I really have had my atheism challenged, and I have not been found wanting.

With the exploration into establishing contact with extraterrestrial life with SETI, I've been wondering - What *if* they respond? What will we learn? I've been finding it near impossible to wrap my head around because I don't know what I don't know. I can't imagine a way of life that I, myself, have not observed or experienced.

Are there any novels that tackle this issue of conceptualizing alien cultures, and if so, which would you recommend? The movie Arrival was fantastic imo, though I am yet to read the literature it was based upon. I've also read the Ancillary Justice series, though its first novel was its only salvageable piece. Don't get me wrong - I love Ancillary. I just want to read something that has really fleshed out the works of the society, something original."

3859,"I apologize if the title is too vague, but I'll try to clarify here.

When I try to write stories, I typically come up with a small number of words for it (like 50-100, sometimes 500). But it's always out of order. One time I may write about some random event in a character's history, and another time, I'm writing about a completely different character in a completely different part of a story.

I had concerns over whether or not this is an issue because I haven't really made anything in the order of beginning to end, and since it seems to be all over the place.

At the same time, I do realize that I am still writing, which is better than not writing. I'm just new to taking it this seriously and want clarification."

3862,"First off I'm not quite sure how to describe this because I've only recently discovered that I do this, but seriously I am an essentially non-empathetic person.  I genuinely can't see things from others' POV.  In discussions with people, I can listen to their points (and even agree with a fair amount of them), but unless they have a logically sound, foolproof argument, I won't ever see things from their side.  As you can imagine, I think this post itself will probably not result in anything, but I hope so!

Also, because I don't ever show empathy, I live my life pretty selfishly.  Now it just so happens that I thoroughly enjoy helping others (I've tutored classmates in anything I'm good at since even middle school), but whenever I am helping others, it's not because I actually want them to succeed or would want someone to help me out if I was in their shoes.  Rather, it's because I get a rush knowing that I helped someone learn something they previously thought they couldn't.  This also applies to the bedroom.  I enjoy pleasing my girlfriend, but I'm not doing it necessarily because I want her to be happy.  I'm pleasing her because (a) she's really hot when she's turned on, (b) having her be happy makes life a lot easier when it comes to other things, and (c) I'm subtly dropping the hint that she should please me too.  

Whenever I'm consciously aware of me doing things like this or actually thinking about this topic, I feel really awful inside.  Like: if I can't relate with other humans, how can I even be real?  At the very least, I honestly do feel like this makes me a horrible person even though on the outside I probably seem largely normal (albeit a little lazy or self-absorbed).  All-in-all, to avoid that sinking feeling again--an admittedly selfish reason in the first place,--I want to change my views on empathy, but I've never been able to convince myself that any other outlook on life is better.  So I was hoping that someone out here could provide a convincing argument and change my view on this matter.

Also, even if you see this post weeks later but still feel you can help, feel free to drop a message or PM me.  I'll be sure to check out everything you say.  Thanks."

I play piano thanks to a bunch of different songs and openings that are found in my favorite anime series (with the help of my friend who is a piano tutor). I now train harder and workout better than ever because of Bakki the Grappler. The World God Only Knows has made me start playing and finishing my games more efficiently (I tried God Mode, to difficult). I also study harder thanks to many cliche anime situations that are held in high school. So what anime did you guys watch that made you try something new or made you better?

Let's share our favorite RP-friendly songs! My pick is ""Cater 2 U"" by Destiny's Child. Despite her proclaimed feminism, Beyonce has several songs in her repertoire that praise and uplift her man. In this song, she does the opposite of ""Dear Future Husband"": the lyrics show that she expresses his admiration for him, cooks for him, keeps him happy, lets him do his favorite activities, and keeps herself looking good for him. All without demanding anything in return! That's the kind of lady I aspire to be.

3904,"For some backstory, I am not an adventist. I am an agnostic. My father has converted to the seventh day faith due to his wife. Whenever I go over to his place to spend some time he and his wife invite me to have Friday night devotion with them and I believed that my stepmother expressed that she thought instrumentation beyond the use of the organ in church was frivolous. She felt like having a band that played in the church distracted from the real message of the music. 

I was wondering if this was a genuine concern of the church as a whole or is this a sentiment only shared by certain groups within the church. 

If this is a sentiment the church holds towards music, then I feel its a shame because I feel there are [tonnes](https://lovelite.bandcamp.com/album/in-three-persons) of Christian bands that are able to spread the gospel while being backed by full bands exploring different types of sounds. "

3912,"I posted here about a month ago about my cystic acne and flakiness/sensitivity caused by retin-a (and maybe too many acne fighting products in general). 

[Original Post Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/15v5jk/help_cystic_acne_flakiness_and_sensitive_skin_can/)

You guys gave me a lot of really good advice so I thought I'd come back with an update... My skin looks AWESOME. For the first time in a year I have no pimples. Not one. After my post I took the advice I got here and ditched the salicylic acid pads and the scrub and I upped my retin-a usage from about once or twice a week to every three days (just started doing every other day this week). I also ended up ditching the clindamycin after getting chronic yeast infections (GROSS) that began a couple of days after I started using it - my doctor says it's unlikely that a topical antibiotic could be causing them but I haven't gotten one since stopping a couple of weeks ago (thank god). 

Currently my routine is: 

Mornings: Wash with Cerave Hydrating Cleanser, gently use a washcloth if needed. Swipe my face with FAB Facial Radiance Pads. GOW Hyalauric Acid Serum. Cerave PM Moisturizer (I don't like the AM one). Elta MD sunscreen (recently switched to this, I like it better than the Kiss My Face one I was using). 

Evenings: Take off makeup with Aveeno makeup removing wipes. Wash with Cerave Hydrating Cleanser. Retin-a or 2.5% benzoyl peroxide. Wait at least 20 min if using retin-a and then Cerave in the tub and vaseline. 

Looking at my old post I also switched my moisturizer from a heavy La Roche Posay one to Cerave - my skin doesn't need that heavy of a moisturizer anymore. I still have some hyperpigmentation but it's going away and the overall quality of my skin is so much better than even before I started breaking out. 

I ran into a guy on Saturday who I had been casually dating in November/December who only really knew me when my acne was at it's worst. I hadn't seen him since Christmas and the first thing he said to me was, ""WOW, you look amazing."" Made me realize that all of the stuff I've been putting on my face is finally working! 

**TLDR**: Retin-a is my miracle drug. Seriously, if it has been prescribed to you WAIT IT OUT. Start slowly and up your dosage every couple of weeks and then just wait - it took two months for me to see results but it was totally worth it. The adjustment period can be pretty awful but it WORKS. I'm sure not for everyone, but it's definitely worth trying if you're struggling with persistent cystic acne. :D"

Lifestyle change begins 01/2012


http://imgur.com/a/q9eWO


I think there are few words that feel as ugly and awkward as the word obese. Its the kind of word that always follows a sympathetic pause in the presence of the paunchy. It is so round and clinical and weighted down with taciturn lowness that it clings to a person in a way that squeezes and cripples him with what is simultaneously the most formidable and and the most elementary malady for a person to beat. January 5, marked one year since I resolved to change myself.This essay will probably be the most gushing and candid thing I’ve ever written, parts of this may seem attention seeking or boastful but I promise that this comes from the deepest, most sincere, and thought-worn parts of my heart. Its something I’ve had kicking around in my head for the better part of 15 years; this is the eulogy for my obesity.


Size has always dominated me, I began to chub around the fourth grade. I wouldn’t say that I was by any means a too-sad kid but I do think that feeling sad was a trigger for me. As a kid I had a difficult time finding a place where I felt like I was supposed to be. Whenever I would venture a try at something new, I would inevitably leave inadequate. I would feel bitter about being rejected by girls or I would feel sad about not being able to keep up with boys. In response I withdrew and went to food. As I grew up, I never felt right and I never I had anything that was mine with which to excel…I would fantasize about accomplishment and taking ownership of the kind of charisma and strength that would enamour me to those girls and make myself a hero in the minds of those guys, but I had lost so much ground over time that the idea of changing anything was daunting. It felt like my life was looming over me and I used food and humor as a means to swat it.


Gaining weight was mostly gradual with a few sharp spikes. It went on slowly until one day I realized that I was a fat kid and at once the idea got stuck in my head. I remember this feeling of compliance like:""well, this is me now."" As I grew older and boundaries widened, I became heavier. I would ride my bike to the Meijer on Clyde Park when it had a McDonalds in it and I would eat a Double Quarter meal Super-Sized and a twenty-piece chicken nuggets, turn around and ride home. This secret meal would lay on top of everything else I eaten during the day and I would enjoy it with stealth in my mind. It didn’t help that I was also slow to develop socially; I didn't have friends yet and food became music for me. It entertained and occupied me. I would go to movies by myself (which I loved doing) I would devour my lonely popcorn and inhale my propitious Pepsi. With every little bit of freedom I enjoyed, my weight gain would apex and level off. When I got my first job (at a pizza joint) I had tons of free food and money to spend on whatever I liked, when I got my license I could travel farther for different brands and combinations of fast food. Every bit of independance further cemented my habits.


Eventually I did develop a bit of a social lean but I still had a hard time accepting myself to my peers, I always felt like my stature stood between us. For example, one year we went to Michigan Adventure, I hadn’t thought much about the seat in a roller coaster and and never had a problem with a lap bar, but then I got in line for The Corkscrew. We waited eagerly and when the time came I walked up to the cart and looked inside and I thought ""shit."" I sat down next to a friend and it was tight but we were both able to sit. I reach up to pull down the shoulder harness and it wouldn’t click. My chest is too far from my back to get the harness to lock. I want to get out but instead an employee comes to me and tries to help by pressing it into me while I 'suck it in' No dice. I stood up and walked away with all the eyes on my back. I held the ride up and I was that fat kid that didn’t fit so I watched my friends ride the coaster from the sidewalk. It was the first time my size made me feel t isolated in front of someone. My attitude was to quietly tack roller coasters on to a list of things I couldn’t do. Eventually I out grew movie theater seats, airplane seats, and ‘Big & Tall’ sections in the mall and I passively waved goodbye to all of them.


And time just passed by - I built powerful, lasting, and comfortable relationships. I worked and had fun but never really achieved anything. I had quiet goals but all of the things I wanted for myself came to be plain conversational fodder, things you get drunk and dream about out loud. Everything I wanted was so public and everything I was was so private. I wanted to act and I wanted to be a comedian. I did open mics and it left me disgusted and exposed, it was a sort of exhilarating misery that kept you facing the goals you pushed away. I gradually lost momentum and just sort of stalled. Life for a few years was like a room dimly lit by the flickering light of a TV. It was quiet, and private, and comfortable. I remained stealthily obsessed with food. It occupied my mind. The flavors and textures and that feeling of occupation in your core gave me a sense of contentment that was so durable that it became ever-present in my life.


I haven’t always lacked a sense of the need for change. Periodically, I would have manic bouts of conviction and backbone. I would face the world and strive to be social, and better, and healthy. I would purse comedy again, I joined gyms, I sought and gained relationships...complacency though eventually had me back in my room eroding from a habit bordering agoraphobia. Eventually I realized that I wasn’t the possessor friends I once was and I became aware of the cheerlessness I felt for myself and that revealed to me the delicacy of the relationships I had. I was pushing people away from me so that I could revel in my faults. I began to see the folly and futility of so many of the years behind me. I became morbidly mindful of my mortality; I would imagine a roommate finding me dead and how they would react. How my family would react. In that, I realized that I’d lived so absent mindedly for so long that I had become OK with being dead when I was 40 and had subconsciously planned to be alone and idle for whatever time I had left. I’d let indulgence and apathy become intuitive.


A dramatic shift in my mindset came to pass around summer 2011. It was also around this time that I, as none of my friends or family knew, auditioned for a weight loss reality show. On the show, overweight men and women are taken away to a fitness sanctuary where they are taught healthy habits and exercise and exercise and exercise ... it was much like a real-life adult version of the movie Heavyweights. While gone, participants don’t communicate with family or friends and then, after an agonizing and heart lifting episode is complete, they are revealed to friends and family in a new body and attitude. I wanted to be a part of that show and thought I had it. I was interviewed and inline to be a part of the show when, abruptly, the series was put on hold and the new season never materialized.

I was devastated. I had poured my future into this idea that I could be taken away and fixed. That I was going to leave and come back as a new person for everyone to hold up cheer for. I had built up tremendous optimism and lost it all just as quickly. I went right back onto the destructive beat I had just left. Looking back, not making it on that show broke something for me and pushed me to get bad enough that I could get better.


Fortunately it only took about six months, I grieved the loss of my spotlight and my champion transformative moment and during that time reflected soulfully about who I am to the people in my life, who I am to myself, and most importantly recognized that I have it in myself to become the kind of person I want to be: I want to constantly be aware of my potential. I want to be a man that knows and practices right from wrong. I want to modestly inspire goodness, optimism, and effort in people; I want my integrity and my character to be something worth holding up. I want to be external and in the lives of people and I want people to feel that having me in their lives is a thing of value. In order to realize these things I had to accept accountability for what had misrepresented my capability and demeaned my resolve for so long. It wasn’t my weight, it was my attitude about life and an enduring lack of enthusiasm for the future.


I took responsibility for my well being one year ago, I weighed 420 pounds, I wore a XXXXXL dress shirt and 48 jeans. My life and the way I lived it literally changed overnight and hasn’t stumbled. I began by eating a calorie restricted diet and eventually shifted to focus on lower carbohydrates. For exercise I started by walking three miles a day. I would take the bus to school, get off walk a ways and get back on further down the route. Once spring rolled around I began to bike. Those rides progressed from two, to six, to ten mile rides, mostly to and from school. Soon the distance between school and home wasn’t clear or long enough so riding became a purposeful thing rather than utility. I rode and rode. By the end of the summer I had joined the half century club having ridden over fifty miles in one ride. In August I began running using the Couch to 5k program and ran my first full 5k on November 17 and putted along to finish my first 10k on December 15. As of today I have lost 178 pounds, wear a large and 34 jeans. I am stronger and faster than I’ve ever felt myself be. I feel appreciation and optimism in everything that I do and I sense that this is the way life should feel. I’ve still got a lot of work to do but at this point the habits have rooted and the education that I’ve gained over the last year will nurture them. I cannot see my life going backwards, this is who I was always supposed to be.


I’ve spent most of my life planning and daydreaming without action and now everything seems so attainable.This is why I write today, I’m ready to say goodbye to that old life now and to focus on maintaining goal oriented momentum and pushing harder so that the strength in my musings becomes the strength in my character. I can do better, I can do better. I can be the Greatest Man in the World.


Thank you to Mom, my Dad, Jerry, My brothers Eric and Adam, Jessica, Marshall, Corey, Colby; you guys specifically have given me clarity and always been frank with be about delicate things. And to Britt, Allen, Jen, Margie, and Alex, you guys give me the happiness I need to suck it up and do it. This might all seem overly sentimental but I only plan on doing this once and you’ve changed my life in ways that can’t really make sense to you.


Part of the audition process for the reality show I mentioned was to create a series of videos focusing on different aspects of my life. I edited one of them and am keeping a few private, but as for the rest, I don’t see a reason to keep it closeted anymore, I feel like that person is gone now. I uploaded these in May 2011, until now it has been accessible only to the producers of the show. For those interested, I have the links listed below. I think they are a thought-provoking relic.

3942,"90 days completed hard-mode mostly.  Had PIV sex two times during the challenge but without O.  This made nofap exponentially more uncomfortable.

Let me begin by saying that the chaser effect is quite real and very strong.  I'm not saying to not enjoy sex, but do not be surprised by how tempting PMO becomes after sex.

A bit about myself, I did not grow up with Internet porn as many here have.  It was Playboys and Cheri and other skin-mags when I was an adolescent, so I felt pretty rebooted after a couple weeks.  I stopped missing porn after about 60 days.  Now I see it as something to be avoided completely.

On to the benefits:

1.  Massively increased ability to concentrate for hours.  Wow.  This alone is worth the price of admission.
2.  An increased appreciation of the beauty of natural everyday women.  
3.  Renewed interest in my hobbies, coupled with more time and motivation leading to more skill, and better outcomes.  Drawing and songwriting are my main hobbies.
4.  Even less anxiety talking to attractive women.  Fuglies were never a  problem, but beautiful women always made me nervous.  They still do, but my desire for intimacy eclipses any nervousness or anxiety.
5.  More masculine and centered.  Even the tone of my voice seems deeper, and I feel an increased muscularity also.  I fit in with the guys better, and have easier conversations with other men.
6.  Less lethargy, less shame, zero guilt.  It feels like I've had an auric cleansing (cleaner aura).  This might be psychosomatic, but I feel like I give off a better 'vibe' than before.  

How I did it, tips and techniques:

1. Cold cold showers each day.  Yes, hydrotherapy really works.  The benefits are many - do a search.
2. Avoid porn/nsfw stuff completely.  For the best results.
3. Do not masturbate - just don't do it.
4. Don't bother telling your friends about it, they wont understand.
5. Cut out reddit, facebook, and other time wasters.  Enjoy only once or twice a day.  
6. Concentrate on your projects: health, business, art, music, social skills, etc.
7. Say 'yes' to every opportunity to socialize!

It is my opinion that the sex drive is good and natural.  It is a motivator for mankind to bring forth great achievements.  It must be channeled and utilized and not wasted with fantasy and masturbation.  Others might disagree, but sex is good.  Learn social skills, learn to be attractive, meet girls/guys whatever.  Get out there!

NoFAP is not a magic pill.  I see it as just one of the basic components of being a true and complete man.  I have no intention of going back to chronic PMO.  If I do relapse, I now know a way out.

Friends, stick with it.  It works.  But do not think of NoFap as something that will elevate you, but rather as a necessary first step in completing your mission.

Also, I am forever grateful for the 90-day challenge and for noFAP.  Thank you fellow fapstronauts.  -ChiunsKimono

Edit: I am 40.  Before NoFAP, I would PMO about 4-5 times a week.

Edit: I did not experience ED before noFAP.  Wow, thanks for all the support!

Edit: I take icy cold showers.  No hot water at all.  And I stay under until my breathing normalizes and my skin feels 'hot'.  This is when you acclimate to the cold-shock.

However, due to a number of factors - rampant drug and alcohol abuse, unstable upbringing, violence, etc. - my job usually boils down to minimizing the amount of conflicts between our residents, trying to introduce a bit of stability in their lives and get them to keep their appointments with the various governmental institutions.

I have seen pretty much everything from fist-fights to stabbings to heart-warming care in the midst of chaos. I could write a book of anecdotes from the stuff I've seen so far (and maybe I will someday), but for now I'd like to share some of my stories with you guys.

I absolutely love my job, and working with homeless people is the best thing to ever happen to me in my professional career. The reason I'm doing this AMA is so all you wonderful redditors can get an insight into a part of society most people never hear about, and hopefully learn something new in the process. Oh, and I apologize in advance for any funkyness in my writing, as English is not my first language.

Oh, as for verification, I'm not quite certain how to prove I am who I say I am. I do have my contract lying around somewhere in case the mods require verification.

Thanks for all the interesting questions guys! It's been a lot of fun, but I'm really tired now so I think I'm gonna hit the bed. I'll check up on this thread sometime tomorrow. Thank you reddit, you guys are awesome!

3945,"When looking at the Mid\-West, it is an extremely flat plain\(indicative of it being weathered for a very long time\). When looking farther West at places like the Colorado Plateau, the Wyoming Basin, and the Rocky Mountains, they aren't as eroded away as the Great Plains and Central Lowlands, despite being at a higher elevation. 

Wouldn't they be the first exposed to weathering from receding oceans thus starting the process of weathering quicker causing them erode much faster? "

As the title already indicates, I am currently looking for books, that are similiar to ""Rendezvous with Rama"".

3951,"I was just going through my books today when I realized that without any conscious effort, I've collected nearly every book written by Alistair Reynolds. That, plus the fact that I'm doing another read-through of Peter Watt's books made me curious about what authors and books everyone else here likes to read. 

My personal favorites are the aforementioned Watts and Reynolds, plus Iain M. Banks , James S.A Corey, and Dan Simmons. Edit: Oh, and I love David Drake's *Hammer's Slammers.*

I used to be partial to Peter F. Hamilton and Neil Asher until I realized that Asher is kinda just a fascist-adjacent Banks knockoff, and Hamilton is weirdly obsessed with very young (but still technically legal) women sleeping with much older men.

3964,"So a bit about myself. I was born in 89' and was raised like any proper HK middle class kid: an action backed week filled with all sorts of classes on and off school-time; glasses-wearing perennial underachiever at every family gathering not because of competition but some unrealistic unfulfilled dreams from the parents. Not a happy childhood, if it was a childhood at all because there was no TV; no computer, no visiting friends at my household. 

Anyway, I went to a traditional all-boys school right across the street from HKU (there are two, so you will have to guess =D) did pretty well in HKCEE, marginally missed the 6-A s mark but I didn't want to do it all over again with HKAL so I asked my parents to send me abroad. Went to Berkeley, gained completed freedom, did economics and politics, instead of chemical engineering as promised to my parents, and actually learned English. 
Have never been back since starting Berkeley even though my family/friends are all in HK. 

Fast forward five years after not finding any job (not American) in the US, went to London with absolutely nothing on an one-way ticket despite not having spent a day there because I thought if I want to do thinktank/diplomacy/energy policy/party politics HK is not really the place to go now. Found work at an OK university up north a few months later and is now (finally) financially independent.

People asked if I dislike HK. I don't, honestly. But it's just that Hong Kong is the exact opposite of what and where I need to be at this point of my career. With housing prices so freaking expensive, its not possible to move out in the American sense. When I was squatting in London I spent a lot of time sitting in the Library of Chatham House (the premier thinktank for international relations here, used to be the home for several prominent British PMs), went to a lot of awesome talks and events on real hardcore IR issues. Once there was the American commander in Iraq, just inches away from me, talking about Sino-American relations. Later I even found out that the headquarters of BP and Rio Tinto are all within cigarette-throwing distance of where I normally spent my afternoons.

Just days ago I landed a gig to write a column on an IR website led by 沈旭暉, focusing on energy politics. It meant a world to me because it had been a lot of sleepless nights in the UK - the feeling on your career going nowhere and the amount of self-doubt ? Literally dream-crushing. I don't know why I am doing this banter. I normally don't even come to this subreddit but the whole getting a small breakthrough thing coupled with not being able to come back to HK to attend a high school friend's wedding as originally planned because now I am actually getting busy made me a tad bit too emotional.

Well. Here you have it. A reverse-angle of your life, my dear UK/US expats in HK.

I think there are few words that feel as ugly and awkward as the word obese. Its the kind of word that always follows a sympathetic pause in the presence of the paunchy. It is so round and clinical and weighted down with taciturn lowness that it clings to a person in a way that squeezes and cripples him with what is simultaneously the most formidable and and the most elementary malady for a person to beat. January 5, marked one year since I resolved to change myself.This essay will probably be the most gushing and candid thing I’ve ever written, parts of this may seem attention seeking or boastful but I promise that this comes from the deepest, most sincere, and thought-worn parts of my heart. Its something I’ve had kicking around in my head for the better part of 15 years; this is the eulogy for my obesity.


Size has always dominated me, I began to chub around the fourth grade. I wouldn’t say that I was by any means a too-sad kid but I do think that feeling sad was a trigger for me. As a kid I had a difficult time finding a place where I felt like I was supposed to be. Whenever I would venture a try at something new, I would inevitably leave inadequate. I would feel bitter about being rejected by girls or I would feel sad about not being able to keep up with boys. In response I withdrew and went to food. As I grew up, I never felt right and I never I had anything that was mine with which to excel…I would fantasize about accomplishment and taking ownership of the kind of charisma and strength that would enamour me to those girls and make myself a hero in the minds of those guys, but I had lost so much ground over time that the idea of changing anything was daunting. It felt like my life was looming over me and I used food and humor as a means to swat it.


Gaining weight was mostly gradual with a few sharp spikes. It went on slowly until one day I realized that I was a fat kid and at once the idea got stuck in my head. I remember this feeling of compliance like:""well, this is me now."" As I grew older and boundaries widened, I became heavier. I would ride my bike to the Meijer on Clyde Park when it had a McDonalds in it and I would eat a Double Quarter meal Super-Sized and a twenty-piece chicken nuggets, turn around and ride home. This secret meal would lay on top of everything else I eaten during the day and I would enjoy it with stealth in my mind. It didn’t help that I was also slow to develop socially; I didn't have friends yet and food became music for me. It entertained and occupied me. I would go to movies by myself (which I loved doing) I would devour my lonely popcorn and inhale my propitious Pepsi. With every little bit of freedom I enjoyed, my weight gain would apex and level off. When I got my first job (at a pizza joint) I had tons of free food and money to spend on whatever I liked, when I got my license I could travel farther for different brands and combinations of fast food. Every bit of independance further cemented my habits.


Eventually I did develop a bit of a social lean but I still had a hard time accepting myself to my peers, I always felt like my stature stood between us. For example, one year we went to Michigan Adventure, I hadn’t thought much about the seat in a roller coaster and and never had a problem with a lap bar, but then I got in line for The Corkscrew. We waited eagerly and when the time came I walked up to the cart and looked inside and I thought ""shit."" I sat down next to a friend and it was tight but we were both able to sit. I reach up to pull down the shoulder harness and it wouldn’t click. My chest is too far from my back to get the harness to lock. I want to get out but instead an employee comes to me and tries to help by pressing it into me while I 'suck it in' No dice. I stood up and walked away with all the eyes on my back. I held the ride up and I was that fat kid that didn’t fit so I watched my friends ride the coaster from the sidewalk. It was the first time my size made me feel t isolated in front of someone. My attitude was to quietly tack roller coasters on to a list of things I couldn’t do. Eventually I out grew movie theater seats, airplane seats, and ‘Big & Tall’ sections in the mall and I passively waved goodbye to all of them.


And time just passed by - I built powerful, lasting, and comfortable relationships. I worked and had fun but never really achieved anything. I had quiet goals but all of the things I wanted for myself came to be plain conversational fodder, things you get drunk and dream about out loud. Everything I wanted was so public and everything I was was so private. I wanted to act and I wanted to be a comedian. I did open mics and it left me disgusted and exposed, it was a sort of exhilarating misery that kept you facing the goals you pushed away. I gradually lost momentum and just sort of stalled. Life for a few years was like a room dimly lit by the flickering light of a TV. It was quiet, and private, and comfortable. I remained stealthily obsessed with food. It occupied my mind. The flavors and textures and that feeling of occupation in your core gave me a sense of contentment that was so durable that it became ever-present in my life.


I haven’t always lacked a sense of the need for change. Periodically, I would have manic bouts of conviction and backbone. I would face the world and strive to be social, and better, and healthy. I would purse comedy again, I joined gyms, I sought and gained relationships...complacency though eventually had me back in my room eroding from a habit bordering agoraphobia. Eventually I realized that I wasn’t the possessor friends I once was and I became aware of the cheerlessness I felt for myself and that revealed to me the delicacy of the relationships I had. I was pushing people away from me so that I could revel in my faults. I began to see the folly and futility of so many of the years behind me. I became morbidly mindful of my mortality; I would imagine a roommate finding me dead and how they would react. How my family would react. In that, I realized that I’d lived so absent mindedly for so long that I had become OK with being dead when I was 40 and had subconsciously planned to be alone and idle for whatever time I had left. I’d let indulgence and apathy become intuitive.


A dramatic shift in my mindset came to pass around summer 2011. It was also around this time that I, as none of my friends or family knew, auditioned for a weight loss reality show. On the show, overweight men and women are taken away to a fitness sanctuary where they are taught healthy habits and exercise and exercise and exercise ... it was much like a real-life adult version of the movie Heavyweights. While gone, participants don’t communicate with family or friends and then, after an agonizing and heart lifting episode is complete, they are revealed to friends and family in a new body and attitude. I wanted to be a part of that show and thought I had it. I was interviewed and inline to be a part of the show when, abruptly, the series was put on hold and the new season never materialized.

I was devastated. I had poured my future into this idea that I could be taken away and fixed. That I was going to leave and come back as a new person for everyone to hold up cheer for. I had built up tremendous optimism and lost it all just as quickly. I went right back onto the destructive beat I had just left. Looking back, not making it on that show broke something for me and pushed me to get bad enough that I could get better.


Fortunately it only took about six months, I grieved the loss of my spotlight and my champion transformative moment and during that time reflected soulfully about who I am to the people in my life, who I am to myself, and most importantly recognized that I have it in myself to become the kind of person I want to be: I want to constantly be aware of my potential. I want to be a man that knows and practices right from wrong. I want to modestly inspire goodness, optimism, and effort in people; I want my integrity and my character to be something worth holding up. I want to be external and in the lives of people and I want people to feel that having me in their lives is a thing of value. In order to realize these things I had to accept accountability for what had misrepresented my capability and demeaned my resolve for so long. It wasn’t my weight, it was my attitude about life and an enduring lack of enthusiasm for the future.


I took responsibility for my well being one year ago, I weighed 420 pounds, I wore a XXXXXL dress shirt and 48 jeans. My life and the way I lived it literally changed overnight and hasn’t stumbled. I began by eating a calorie restricted diet and eventually shifted to focus on lower carbohydrates. For exercise I started by walking three miles a day. I would take the bus to school, get off walk a ways and get back on further down the route. Once spring rolled around I began to bike. Those rides progressed from two, to six, to ten mile rides, mostly to and from school. Soon the distance between school and home wasn’t clear or long enough so riding became a purposeful thing rather than utility. I rode and rode. By the end of the summer I had joined the half century club having ridden over fifty miles in one ride. In August I began running using the Couch to 5k program and ran my first full 5k on November 17 and putted along to finish my first 10k on December 15. As of today I have lost 178 pounds, wear a large and 34 jeans. I am stronger and faster than I’ve ever felt myself be. I feel appreciation and optimism in everything that I do and I sense that this is the way life should feel. I’ve still got a lot of work to do but at this point the habits have rooted and the education that I’ve gained over the last year will nurture them. I cannot see my life going backwards, this is who I was always supposed to be.


I’ve spent most of my life planning and daydreaming without action and now everything seems so attainable.This is why I write today, I’m ready to say goodbye to that old life now and to focus on maintaining goal oriented momentum and pushing harder so that the strength in my musings becomes the strength in my character. I can do better, I can do better. I can be the Greatest Man in the World.


Thank you to Mom, my Dad, Jerry, My brothers Eric and Adam, Jessica, Marshall, Corey, Colby; you guys specifically have given me clarity and always been frank with be about delicate things. And to Britt, Allen, Jen, Margie, and Alex, you guys give me the happiness I need to suck it up and do it. This might all seem overly sentimental but I only plan on doing this once and you’ve changed my life in ways that can’t really make sense to you.


Part of the audition process for the reality show I mentioned was to create a series of videos focusing on different aspects of my life. I edited one of them and am keeping a few private, but as for the rest, I don’t see a reason to keep it closeted anymore, I feel like that person is gone now. I uploaded these in May 2011, until now it has been accessible only to the producers of the show. For those interested, I have the links listed below. I think they are a thought-provoking relic.

3975,"Hi. New poster here. 19, diagnosed about a year ago. Been dealing with BPD since about 14. Surprisingly, getting better. Ive been in 2 different DBT groups and have noticed an improvement. I still have those ""BPD"" days, or hours, or minutes. But they ar getting easier. I still self sabotage, dont put myself into DBT and utilize it a much as i should. But its a fight, a fight im slowly winning.


It scares me, to know im getting better. Its not a place ive ever been, and the unknown is terrifying. My doctor put me on new meds about 7 months ago and they actually worked and helped and i was scared because they worked. so i stopped taking them, or took them less. But the pain in others eyes when i tried to explain, like to my bf for example, helped me get back on them. Still feel scared sometimes, but also hopeful..For the future. 

Anyways, i'd like to tell anyone iffy about it to do DBT. If you are lucky enough to have the opportunity, seize the day. Also, another thing that has helped me shine light into my own self has been the book ""sometimes i act crazy.""
that book taught me a lot about myself. Check it out. =)"

3977,"Like a puppet, on the stage

Laughter, cries, fits of rage

He contemplates his every breath

As strings pull and lift his chest


every move employs a creek

A groan, a moan, an anguished weep

He tosses and turns, awake at night

His chest, his heart, somethings not right


He thinks subtle thoughts he wouldn't say aloud

As he glares into the darkness of the crowd

He is not human, he is wood and puppet strings

He doesnt feel, he doesnt bleed


The final exposition and lights cast down

His strings are tangled, this happens now

One last look at the lights above

He severs his strings, and drops with a thud.

I love the idea of little secret pockets of green hidden in cities. I love when people reclaim tar rooftops and use them to grow food for their family and friends. I also noticed that there was no dedicated subreddit for rooftop garden aficionados like myself, so I went ahead and created one.

A bit about me: I've been suffering from anxiety and depression for much of my life, with my mental health reaching an all-time low within the past year. Since making a few life changes, I've finally turned a corner and feel better than I've felt in a long time. For all those still suffering, stay strong. You are in my thoughts and I wish you the best.

Now, to my question: in the course of my research of depression, I remember stumbling across information regarding a cultural perspective on depression that I found uplifting. My gut is telling me that it is from a Native American culture, though I do not know which and cannot find sources.

Essentially, this cultural perspective viewed depression as something to be celebrated, an indication of a life out of balance and an opportunity to reflect and reset. 

I think that's a wonderful way to think about depression, and it provided me with a great deal of comfort in my darker days. However, I'd like to seek out sources for this perspective. If anyone has any information on this, please send it my way!"

For me, it's running.  Fast.  Sometimes, I get down on all-fours and haul ass like Leto II (Children of Dune reference).

About 2.5 years ago, I was 23 years old and weighing in at 350 lbs on a 6' frame. Sitting in the office of a weight loss specialist, she only offered up one recommendation: weight loss surgery. I kind of panicked at that point. I was 23 years old, a PhD student, and full of questions. That was a defining moment in my life process. I had the setback of a severely broken foot that required two surgeries and an extended healing process. Towards the end of the healing process, I heard about a local pool that offered water aerobics and thought it would be a good way to start moving towards exercise without being high impact on my foot. After the first class, I realized that water aerobics just wasn't my style. I decided to return to the pool during open swim to try out laps. I was nervous and rocking a ridiculous leopard print halter top one piece because it was the only swimwear I had. At the beginning, it was all I could do to get one length of the pool (25 yards) completed at a time. And this is where I started. I swam as much as I could each day and loved every minute of it. I have found that swimming is very therapeutic in a lot of ways - physically and mentally. At the same time, I started using the myfitnesspal website and app. I was very careful and obsessive about the calories for a long time. The pounds didn't come off quickly at first and this was very discouraging, but gradually, the weight loss began to show.

I wanted to watch this movie for two reasons:

-It is one of Martin Scorsese's favourite movies (he funded the restoration of the film through his foundation)

-Daren Aronofsky said that this movie was his inspiration for Black Swan 

The movie turned out to be very good. It tells the story of an aspiring ballet dancer faced with a very demanding opera director. There are several dancing scenes, but you don't have to be interested in ballet to appreciate the film, and the restored copy of the movie is magnificent.

My whole life has lead to this moment

and to every moment after,

When I understood, the fear was gone,

Yugen inspired I lead my Tribe-

on our icy path across the great divide.



When asked my dreams and aspirations

My dreams of what never was-

and what is still to come

When asked who I am, what I wish to be-

I smile, and reply,

Me.

A video created to give hope to those that have suffered abuse. Women have come together to make a stand. We are standing up for men, women and children that have or are being abused! 
Giving them a voice! 
I have never felt so inspired by the hope that has been created from this!

5573,"Sorry about the weird title. I couldn't think of a better one.

Oscar Pistorius has featured heavily in the news today. I personally consider him a role model, someone I often think about when I feel lazy or unmotivated. His determination, guts, never-say-die spirit. Not to mention he's a guy who has no legs but can run. If that's not inspiring I don't know what is. I am enormously saddened by what has happened today. I don't want to add any fuel to the speculation fire, but even if he is guilty, it wouldn't diminish my respect for and admiration of him. It doesn't take away the reasons I considered him a role model in the first place, and I feel it doesn't tarnish his accomplishments or the work he put in to earn them.

I feel the same way about John Lennon. Though he was a terrible person, it doesn't take away from his musical achievements. This can be applied to a plethora of musicians, athletes, politicians, scientists etc.

Obviously human beings are by nature flawed, and it is unfair and unrealistic to hold role models up to a better standard than the rest of us. There should be context and perspective when judging them.

But is there something a role model could do that would negate any of their achievements in their field? Something that would make you completely lose admiration and respect for them? Has it happened before and with whom?

5578,"Cons of my life :

- I don't know the birth dates of anybody in my family, besides my brother, who's two days apart (different year)

- I barely know anyone in my family, even though I've visited them, I could care less about getting to know them, even my own parents.

- I have friends who never invite me to anything, which is odd because I rarely do anything to make me a disliked person, no one really responds to me in a negative way, I'm just a boring guy.

- I do the same thing almost every day, I wish I could do more, I wish I could get to know more people, I love talking, it's just that everyone I know is just so fucking boring and so fucking different.

- I can almost remember anything in my life, that's how dull and boring it is.

- I get a hard reaction from drugs, is it because I'm so empty that merely one hit can impact deeply?

- I rarely laugh at jokes

- I've almost never cried in my life, maybe a few times in my life, but it mainly because I didn't get something my way.

- If my someone in my family died tonight I would honestly not care at all, not in the slightest bit.

- Typing this out makes me look like the shittiest person alive, but I honestly wish I could relate to someone, I wish I could socialize, I wish I was able to do things, I'm just so used to be being boring and held back all the time that it has stuck with me greatly.

- When I think things like ""what if there was no existence?"" ""what if I was set in a different year in time?"" ""why does life exist?"" ""what if I just die?"" it makes me feel so great inside, like a small instance of euphoria

- ..But then I think ""well what if this is all my imagination?"" ""but wouldn't that make my imagination imaginative as well?"" ""what if the world is fake?"" ""well the my thoughts would be fake?"" ""why does everything feel so artificial?"" which just puts me more down, I'm not sure

- I never go anywhere

- I'm a shitty eater

- I'm terribly skinny

- I'm sitting down almost 70 percent of the day

- I have the urge to do something that'll kill me slowly, like start smoking cigarettes, or fuck up my body in some kind of way

- Everything I did enjoy slowly disappears, delayed video games (make a guess), ending TV shows (things that kept me from thinking about my own life), my mother moving out of the country, other bullshit

- School fucking sucks (sixteen year old, sophomore in HS)

- I'm almost nocturnal, I hate being awake during day

- Shit grades, I can do the work I just fucking hate putting in the effort and could care less

Pros of my life :

- I'm a fairly good artist

- I have a unique taste in music which I enjoy very much

- I love writing and letting my imagination go

- Food tastes good

- I'm not poor, and I'm not in a state of disgust

- I'm around pretty good people, (even though most of them are uninteresting as fuck)

Sure you might think, ""Oh well, you kind of did that to yourself, you chose to be boring"". Honestly I didn't, I live with the most boring/paranoid father in the world, won't let me go anywhere and won't take me anywhere. As for the making friends part, I'm not much of an outcast, I just can't relate to anyone, I do have current friends but I try to keep myself looking happy around them, but even that tends to fail.

I really can't find a place for my on this earth. I've tried finding one, but I really can't, and there's not point in trying to find one either.

I don't know what to do tbh. I may just be extremely selfish or something, I have no idea. Maybe it'll better for others if I just died. I may kill myself, or I might just live the rest of my life doing nothing and see where that takes me. Bleh."

5585,"I'm 20 years old, and I started creating a world when I was about 8 years old. It was very simple with no long-term premise, just a fantasy about me and a bipedal dragon wrecking havoc on earth. But it grew into something before long, and it's been about 12 years since then and a lot have things have changed and evolved in a lot of different ways.

I was thinking recently about how the world has evolved, how the main characters moved to different locations over time, how they grew up, how their morals, their personalities, their additudes changed. All the concepts of the world grew more complex as I started being capable of understanding more, as I started learning about somewhat more complex sciences such as physics and chemistry in high school, and how I learned about more practical applications of those sciences in college. I even thought about how the characters physically aged, how I actually picture them as taller than I used to and how even characters that I added in over the years have aged somewhat. Sometimes I even think about how I've attributed individual personalities and preferences to different characters even though, in all reality, they're all just personifications of myself.

When I was a kid, it didn't matter what happened, or how it happened. It wasn't real, and it didn't matter, it was just a fantasy and I could do it however I wanted to. But I've grown attached to it like I never thought I would, and while I like to keep the fantasy side of it intact, I like to apply everything I've learned to make it feel real, like things that happened in that world really matter, because to me, it really does matter. I've applied moral concepts, scientific concepts, philosophical concepts, religious concepts, and whatever happened to be on my mind at the time. It's become my identity, and it's become the single most complex thing I will ever comprehend."

My current definition springs from the laws that are in every country (do not murder, steal, rape, ect) and it is ""Imposing your will on someone else against theirs"" There are many forms of grey in it. Such is the human condition. However I think it is a good definition. What do you all think?"
5589,"Help me expand my list. It doesn't matter if it's something you know how to do or not, it's never too late to learn something new. I plan on introducing my kid to as many of these as possible (via video or pictures or whatever) and then dive into whichever one he responds to the most. He's only 6 weeks now, so I have a little while to wait ; )

Here are some ideas I've come up with. Obviously they can be combined, though I like the idea of focusing on one to really establish a skill base, and also because time and money for most are pretty limited.

1. **Astronomy/Stargazing** If you have a good enough set up, you can even help to locate things that professional astronomers have their eye out for, such as supernovas and asteroids, etc.

2. **Woodworking** You can keep it purist with just hand tools, or juice it up with some power tools if that's more your thing.

3. **Survivalism** Get lost in the woods, build traps, go fishing, throw knives at targets, hunt, etc.

4. **Graphic novels** If your kid is more of an indoor/bookish type, the world of graphic novels and comics is pretty massive and intriguing. You could also write/animate your own.

5. **Amateur archaology** and/or **treasure hunting** w/ metal detector. A good one to combine with **geocaching**.

6. **Historical reenacting** (pioneers, civil war, etc.)

7. **Scuba diving and/or harpooning**

8. **Video production** and **movie making**

9. **Rock climbing** and **spelunking** I'm crossing my fingers he won't choose this one.

Any other ideas? Personally, I'm hoping my kid will take a liking to survivalism, but I'm more than willing to bend my own interests to suit his personality/lifestyle choices. If the kid decides he wants to be a fashion designer, I'll be out the next morning to pick up some issues of Vogue."

It is time to set down the pre-workout shake, cup of coffee, large drink of water, gallon of milk, or whatever it is you are drinking this morning, stop for a few minutes, reflect, and think back on all the things you did this week on behalf of your fitness.  Then, find the one, best thing you did on behalf of your fitness, and mark it, your Fitness Victory.  **We want to hear about it.** 

Perhaps, as your schedule tightened and you worried you wouldn't make the time for your fitness, but you did so after all.  Or, perhaps you dug deep as your workout became more and more challenging, and found a reserve of strength you didn't know you had.  Perhaps you lifted a lot more weight than you thought you had it in you to lift.  Or perhaps you dutifully went about the business, eating your planned macros and calories, grabbing the gym bag and heading out the door at the appointed times, hitting that bed at an early enough hour to make sure you get the rest your body needs to get stronger.  Perhaps you pulled a big ol' deadlift, 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x bodyweight. Perhaps you ran far, ran strong, ran hard, ran well.   Perhaps you did more pullups than you ever have before, or you did your very first pullup, or your first pullup since high school or, dang it all, you did pullups.    Perhaps you learned to stop worrying about what others think, and instead focus on what you are thinking.  


Here are last week's **Top five fitness Victories:** 

* **ogareg (120 points)** I am now ranked 35 in Sweden in badminton, males 18-19 years old, giving me a free ticket to the Swedish Championships this spring!

* **kmdg22c (121 points)** Got rejected by a girl. Instead of being butthurt, I set PRs for deadlift, squat, and reps for pull-ups. Now, butt hurts, but DOMS is a much better reason.

* **Strikerrjones (70 points)** I hit a [305 paused bench press](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgW6TJ1AJp4&sns=em) while my 6 year old son yelled at me for motivation. I got a 12"" metal log, and after failing the first time, managed to clean and press 200 pounds with it (lolweak). Earlier in the week, I deadlifted 5 plates for a triple after a failed PR attempt, then yesterday I deadlifted 4 plates for 14 reps, both of which are rep PRs. I bench pressed 2 plates for 14 reps, which is a rep PR. All of this was between 175-180 pounds body weight. This week was pretty awesome.

* **Mshotts (71 points)** Probably not the right place, but it is a personal victory and I've been using fitness to try to turn my life around. Today, I am one month clean and I'm very happy.

* **flocculous (59 points)** After spending a few months messing around with dumbbells at home, I grew a pair of ovaries and started Starting Strength in the ""scary"" gym - today will be my third session. Wish I'd done it sooner!

**The ""You're Awesome"" Spotlight.**
 
This week, the spotlight shines on acconrad who performed a 385lb squat at a weight of 189 pounds for an official 2x bodyweight squat! This, on the same day he hit a personal record for repetitions on his deadlift, 4 times 405lbs. For a pair of incredible fitness goals hit on the same day: **acconrad, You're Awesome!**

The ""You're Awesome"" spotlight is an occasional feature of Victory Sundays, wherein I select a deserving recipient to receive the eponymous adulation, in celebration of their previous Sunday's Victory. If you want to nominate someone for the ""You're Awesome"" spotlight, simply respond to their post with ""You're Awesome!""

Second Disclaimer: I in no way am saying I think Studio Ghibli is stealing or taking liberty with old or past stories.

Without cheating to Wikipedia. Is it just me, or are some of these movies inspired? I've probably only seen half maybe of SG's work.

But....

Spirited Away runs like Alice In Wonderland.
Howl's Moving Castle feels like Wizard of Oz.
Ponyo is a cute version of Little Mermaid.
Secret World of Arriety is obviously The Borrowers. 
And even though I haven't seen it in ages so I couldn't tell you what exactly. But Kiki's Delivery Service always left me reminded of something. Like a song on the tip of your tongue but not yet stuck in your head.

Just curious what others thought. And if there is a correlation, what other of there films are parallel to American or other Countries movies. I love SG more than American Animated movies now. But I do like seeing relations between different stories and thinking Ghibli did it better."

5609,"First off, pics: http://imgur.com/a/69JUQ 

300+ suspected, 290 confirmed down to 205 this morning.

Ok, so I know I'm a little late for the New Year update bandwagon, but I just earned my -85lbs flair today.  It's been a crazy year.  I'm sure I was at or above 300 lbs when I started losing weight.  Highest confirmed by a scale was after I started losing and that was 290.  So I'm just counting from 290.

I started out 2012 with the typical resolution to diet and exercise and lose weight.  I had asked my parents for a gym membership for Christmas 2011 which they kindly obliged.  I started going every day.  At first it was 45 minutes between some light lifting and cardio.  I limited myself to between 1,200 and 1,300 calories a day using MyFitnessPal to track it.  My gym sessions got longer and longer.  By the end of the year, I was there 2 hours a day.  I was lifting good weight and running 3-4 miles a day.  Back in August, I had lost 45lbs on this diet and exercise routine.  I saw my doctor and he suggested switching to Keto after reading some studies about it.  Since then, I've lost another 40lbs on keto and exercise.  No calorie limits or anything.  In October, I saw an endocrinologist who diagnosed me with gynocomastia.  I'm now taking pills and my chest is shrinking.  Still too embarrassing to post shirtless pictures though.  In that first picture with the orange hoodie, I was easily filling out an XXL and 42 waist pants.  In the last pictures (with the purple tshirt) I'm wearing size L shirts and 34 waist pants.  

I'm still not done.  I don't have a goal weight really, but I want abs and some muscle definition, so that's my goal instead of a number on the scale.  But that goal will take me below 200lbs for sure.

The weight loss has come with some huge mental changes as well.  I'm a lot happier and more confident.  I'm better with women.  I actually have girls come up to me to flirt with me now.  It's kinda crazy.  But unfortunately I'm still self conscious and mentally I'm still the fat kid.  I hope that goes away in 2013.  And thanks to anybody that bothered to read that monster wall of text.  "
5610,"Sorry for the length, but I think it is a worth wile.

Yesterday I was sitting with bunch of my friends in this small bar at my home city. I don’t have an apartment in that city atm, because my studies are in another town. I notice three girls having an argument, because one of the girls tossed a drink on another. The “attacker” left from the bar and these two girls sat down table near me and my mates, both HB8 (2 set). I gave them a second to recover from the drink episode, but then I approached.  

**Opening:** “Woah ladies... Fighting like that in a bar is not appropriate. What’s up with you?”



While approaching I opened my arms and as ballsy and big I could be I sat down in their table, and leaned back. **(Usually people say “look like you are not staying”, but I decided to go as strong as I can because they just had so big emotional impact before my approach (the fighting))** Usually I don't act as ""ballsy or ass-hole-kinda-like-a-way"" but I remind you, they were acting too much like queens in the beginning.



I didn’t point the opening to either of girls, because it tells a lot from the set who talks first and more. I already had picked my target which was the one who got tossed the drink on.

 
Targets friend: “That slut accused us being superficial and fake, because we use make up and artificial nails, then she tossed a drink on **targets name**”


Me shooting a beehive: “I guess your eyes are not brown either.” 
Targets Friend: “No, they are actually blue, these are contact lenses.”

Target was totally ignoring the situation and figuring out does her clothes smell like beer.

Me to the target “That wasn’t fun, was it *targets name*?” **(use the name when you get it)**
Target: “No it wasn’t and I smell like beer.” Cocky as fuck
At this point I considered it to be smart to lift her value to get her back in the game.



Me: “Who cares what you smell like, when you look like that?”
Target: “What the fuck do you mean, I look like what?” (Annoyed)
I raised my glass to her and ballsy as alpha: “Beautiful”
This dropped her shield for a split second and thats when I decided to do **“best friend test”** as mystery does it. 
Me: “I see you are good friends am I right?”
They: “Yes we are”
Me: “How about I try something to figure out how good friends you are.”
Tell them it is a “best friend test” and ask a question and regardless of the answer just point out, that they looked at each other before answering. I asked the question from the target’s friend, because I only had the target’s name. 
Me: “What is *targets name* favorite movie.” 
And BUM they look at each other, point the glance and say that you don’t have to answer anymore and explain the test. 
They laugh and I notice they have out of town accent.



Me: “I notice you are not from here.” **(Don’t ask, claim)**
They: “How do you know.”
Me: “Well you seem to get in to a trouble a lot and you have funny accent.” 
They: “We did not start...”
Me interrupting: “Yeh yeh, not interested about that anymore. I think you are from: (insert funny place here)” **What I did, I raised my value by interrupting (not always a good plan but they were still too cocky).** I also made them answer to my question without asking anything. 



From here it was easy small talk for a few minutes and the point was to figure out if they lived in the town (important ‘cos I didn’t have an apartment there). They were roommates and old friends from way back and now studying here etc.



I saw my friend walking past the table and I waved him to come over. He did. I introduced him to the girls by saying:



“I have friends too, this is Marcus, Marcus they are...” 
And the girls give their names, so now I got both of their names without introducing myself.
Me to the girls: “So *Name here* and *name here*, I’m being very rude to my friends by chatting here, so I got to do something about it.” And I leave the set, but just for a while so they can talk through everything that has happened in short time.



I get back to my own table with guys and have fun! After 15 minutes of ignoring the eye fucking from the girls, I see they are finishing their drinks. I get up and go to the bartender to order a beer before they get up, but of course the girls come order more as well.



Me: “Are you following me?” (Fully playful at this point)



Target: “No, just came to get drinks.” (Kinda flirty)
Me: “Yeh we can get drinks together.”
Girls order and we go to table. 

Now... My friends are not that good wingmen and it is hard to wing them for their lack of effort with girls. So I was on my own with two girls, **but I had to escalate!!!** 



I decided to kino the target by hand reading, which is totally cold reading when I do it. I followed her reactions and get clues about her and I did very well. After I suggested she would read her friends hand and tried the same thing. Soon I noticed I held both of their hands together and kinoed them both. This was new to me, but I improvised. I made them innocently touch each other (hold your hands and close your eyes kind of things that I just made up at the scene). They reacted openly and I decided it was time to bounce away from my friends. It was easy as “Wanna go somewhere else?” they said yes. We got out of the bar and girls suggested if we go to a bar near them so they can get home easier. I said “Why don’t we just go to your place to have fun if you have something to drink?” **(Again ballsy move, but I really didn’t want to waste my time on possible “attention ladies”.)** They loved the idea and after a quick taxi ride we were there. 


We came to the apartment and on the way there I decided **""I am going for 2/1 and nothing less”**. I had to figure out pretty fast how to build up the tension, because if we land on friendship level when in new environment, we are gonna stay on that level. I took the lead and made the girls sit down on a small couch. I asked what do they want to drink and it was all fun and games, because obviously I didn’t know where everything was. I was in the kitchen and they were in the living room couch.



(It was important to be further away from them, because they obviously needed time to negotiate about 2/1, which was totally idea floating in the air.)


Then I bring them the drinks and there is no space for me in the couch. **I could have squeezed myself in, but that is not a good thing to do.** You don't have room to work and the tension doesn't build up by strong contact, it comes softly and “accidentally” touching another. **Touching that awakes questions is sexy, but yelling with your body is not.** I went on the floor, sitting manly, drinking beer and just watched these girls giggling and sipping their drinks, I didn’t say a word. I waited for a question...


Target 1: “Why are you there? Do you wanna come here?” And she pointed the couch.


I said: “No, from here I can see better when you kiss.” I made clear that I had the controls and this is important: **Always be in the lead**, because they are so high on emotional and sexual level, they need your guidance, even if you don’t know what you are doing, you are the only stranger there!!!

They smiled and slowly started kissing, I didn’t go in, I waited until it became more “real”, that they started to enjoy... I then slowly approached, touching their hands and legs, helping them to get closer to each other!


As I was removing their high heels and touching their legs softly I made them touch each other with their legs, in a gently and sexy way. It was only a few seconds and then they started to do it on their own. (I was kneeled on the floor at the time) I didn’t do anything else in 15 seconds to give them time, I wasn’t in hurry. They kept on kissing all this time and then I took the other girls hand and moved it to another girls thigh. Gave them 10 seconds in my head again, and did the same to the other girl. It escalated slowly to a dry hump, simply by moving them step by step towards each other.**Guiding!!!!**




When they started kissing, it got more and more fiery! Now they obviously wanted each other too much to quit - It was time for me to join in more. I started by helping them undress, kissing their necks, sometimes on their mouths, but I immediately guided them back to each other. They ignited something and I helped, like taking off the bra or panties. I was still on the floor and they were both on the small couch. **This is your role! To help them feel sexy, wanted and confident with the situation!** You make both girls feel equal and sexy!! I still had my clothes on when they had already eaten each others out for a good time. 
After we fully focused on them, suddenly they just jumped on me in huge rampage kinda like horny blast. They ripped my suit off from me probably in 5 seconds, my shoes just flew off and suddenly two hotties were literally giving my wiener a ride of its life! After a while, the other kept on sucking while the other went and took a condom. They put it on together with their mouths. In this point I let them know, that they are doing awesome job and gave them compliments!! After a while we started to have sex and remember, in MFF, it can take fucken hours, and if you happen to come, keep on going, kissing touching and soon enough you are ready to another round. You can change the pace a lot, sometimes kissing, sometimes ramming, sometimes touching and just oral...



Remember:
When having sex 2 on 1, it is not about you! So sometimes I just pulled out and helped these girls to pleasure each other by licking and fingering, giving them compliments that only a horny guy can give and treating them equally and pleasuring them both in the best way I can. Sometimes my boner was gone, but it got up fast when girls wanted it again. It is not conventional sex, it is an adventure between you three. Remember if you take a break, DRINK WATER! Two months ago I saw these girls in a bar and they suggested if we could do it again that night. I wasn't up for it, because the other one was too drunk and I had early morning, but for me it meant that I did something right ‘cos they want it again.


**In summary:**


**Improvise** (Don’t use same lines, openers, games, techniques, mix them up and take chances!!!)


**Be strong** (Stand behind what you say and when you say something, mean it)


**Be creative** (More fun to you and probably to them too)


**In 2/1 situation:** (Make everyone feel sexy and wanted - you are not in hurry so take your time - you are there to make them feel good not to “pleasure/penetrate them” - make the situation natural by showing example (not telling) - it is not conventional sex so don’t act like it (you might not be the center of attention or even half of it) -  and of course, confidence)

5615,"I grew up Mormon. Born and raised. I was really into it. Over the past 5 years, I've slowly been changing my views of religion to a less ""organized"" view point and more of what makes me feel comfortable while still believing in a ""Christian God"". Now I am dating an atheist and we've spent some time together talking about science, religion, watching Cosmos and talking about Carl Sagan. This is the first time I've really started to think that everything I have known and have loved my whole life might have been a lie and isn't true at all. Frankly, it scares the living shit out of me. I've always felt as if it was the foundation for who I am. Also the thought that after death, you just cease to exist...[shiver]... Is me holding onto potentially a silly belief to somehow bring me comfort a ridiculous thought? I just look back at 27 years, back to my baptism, to going in the temple, doing baptism for my dead relatives, the times I felt ""the Holy Ghost"", the times I declared my faith with such surety as a child and young adult, how does one just give it up? The scientific facts are overwhelming and I keep trying to see if somehow I can fit a god into the equation. That some being instigated the Big Bang, actually instigated the whole billions of years of evolution, and doesn't really intervene at all with our lives, but is just a watchful eye. Sort of feels like the Matrix. That I am about to take the red pill to go down the rabbit hole but I am so terrified to do it. For any of you who have been very religious at one point or another and have become atheist, how did you deal with this internal conflict?"

5621,"Just wondering. I for one am actively working to start performing drag, just thought I'd see if any of the girls of r/crossdressing have considered performing. While there is an unspoken (albeit wrong IMO) precedent that a drag queen must be gay, I believe the ability and desire to present one's self as female should be all that is required. Several of my drag friends agree with this sentiment, although I should mention that I identify myself as bisexual. Anyway, just thought I'd ask:)"

5626,"So I'm sitting here at my computer on a Saturday night listening to some post-rock music that always makes me seem to contemplate life more than anything else and I got thinking. I mean, I've recently graduated post-secondary school with a diploma and moved cities to pursue a career but I'm still not sure if this is... ""it"" you know? And when I get to thinking that I'm not so sure if this is indeed ""it"" then I worry I might be wasting my time with this when I could be doing other things such as going to school for something else.

What's really frightening is that fact that I don't seem to really have any goals in my life currently and thus, when I get in these moods, it makes everything worse.

BUT...enough complaining.

5630,"I work in Beauty Supply, so I see a lot of pretty fancy nails come through my store, and spend a lot of my time at work talking about nail polish.  I cannot tell you how rare it is to do the kinds of designs and art that we do, by ourselves.

When people comment on my nails, they almost always assume that they are 1.  Decals/nail apps or 2.  Done professionally.  And my designs don't always look perfect or anything; I just put a lot of time into it.  When I notice other people's fancy nails and comment on them, they almost always refer me to the nail tech who did the design for them.

Now, I'm not hating on anybody who opts to have their nails done professionally.  I get it; it's time consuming, and takes a lot of practice to do what we do.  BUT we should all take a moment to be proud of ourselves and our rogue nail art abilities.

And for all of you who I see posting things like ""I know I'm not as good as some of you, but..."":  Stop it.  Just stop.  You are awesome because you try and you do it yourself, which is a lot more than the general population can say.  Keep it up, you amazing, creative, talented lacqueristas."

I am searching for books about the art and craft of ceramics to expand my knowledge of the field, and want others to find out about theses sources to expand their knowledge as well.  Anyways, the only book that I have read that was of tremendous use to me is ""Clay and Glazes for the Potter"" by Daniel Rhodes.  It is a very informative book on how to formulate clay bodies and glazes, amongst other things.  If you have the ability, I would buy it and read it a couple of times to make sure all of the information sinks in.  One other book that I have heard of from my professor is ""Pioneer Potter"", which I am going to try and acquire next.  Now my question is, does anyone else have any books (or other sources) where to find necessary information for the advancement of one's ceramic career?"

Edit: Added more information.  Hope its enough and I'm not to long winded.  Any questions feel free to ask!!!

Edit2: tried to make my wall of text better


I'm 23 y/o, 6 ft 2 inches


Skinny Picture I was around 155
After picture I weighed in at 184.  


Food wise:
Being the kid who could stay skinny no matter what I ate I took to the food route.  Eat as much High Protein stuff as I can (try to be clean stuff). Lean chicken and turkey can be your best friend.  I make a salsa chicken in the crock pot all the time.  Pretty cheap and easy. 
* 2lbs of chicken
* 10oz can of creme of chicken soup
* 16oz jar/can of salsa
Mix the two cans together pour over the chicken and cook on low for 6ish hours.  Shred the chicken and put back into crockpot, add 2 spoonfuls of sour cream to the mix and eat.  Its great over rice, by itself or with totilla chips.


The only Supplement I added was a protein shake after I worked out. None of that fancy super fancy stuff just some cheap stuff from [GNC](http://www.gnc.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3267268&cp=3593187.2108294), only $50 for a 5lb container with around 71 servings (one scoop) I usually took two scoops/


Basic routine breakdown.
**Monday**
Chest exercises 
**Tuesday**
Back and Shoulders
**Wednesday**
Legs
**Thursday**
Random stuff I felt like working more on that week.
**Friday Saturday Sunday**
These were usually rest days, but sometimes I would go in and do some stuff still, and sometimes start the week over early depending on how I felt.


I can't really tell you exercises I did cause it changed a lot along with the big stuff that everyone knows for each muscle group.  When you get bored of what you're doing look up videos online of the muscle group your going to work out next and do those exercises you don't always do.


Find a friend to help you when you get started.  I got lucky and had a buddy who was a football player for a small college who was will to work out with the weak kid and got me started.  It also gives you a great reason to keep going if you have someone that will make you go.


The biggest thing it takes is persistence, keep working even when you think you're not getting anywhere.  Change stuff up and continue to try new exercises."
5635,"In the wake of many such posts over the past few days (weeks/months -- let's be serious here), and with an invitation of sorts having been extended to certain members of the major gaming communities on Reddit, we're happy to offer this space today to discuss the many intersections between gaming and history.

Some possible topics to discuss include, but are not limited to:

- The history of games and ludology generally

- The use of games as a tool for teaching history
 
- Pursuant to the above, which games are most accurate or useful?

- What about otherwise?

- Of possible particular interest: given that video games nowadays offer much greater scope for visual artistry than they did in the past -- and, consequently, for greater possible accuracy of visual depiction -- are there any older games that are nevertheless notable for their rigor and accuracy in spite of technological limitations?

- Do those creating a game that takes place within a historical setting have the same duties as an historical researcher?  The author of an historical novel?  If they differ, how do they?

- On a far more abstract level, of what value is game theory to the study of history?

These questions and more are open to discussion.  We welcome any guests who may wish to contribute, but remind them -- as we periodically remind all our readers -- that /r/AskHistorians has a set of strictly-defined rules when it comes to posting.  Please [take a moment to read them](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules) before diving in!

5655,"/edit - Well folks! My sister, [losermedia](http://www.reddit.com/user/losermedia) came over to help me pick a winner, and we couldn't decide! So, we have two winners! And those people are....

**dielectric_eating** - For their facts about parrots! Too cute! 

and

**modernmist** - For their facts about the sun. The conversation eventually led to a documentary being posted about a man who makes music with the [sun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcqiLvHiACQ), and it was one of the most beautiful and creative things I had seen in so long. Data Sonification....what an amazing idea. 

So thanks everyone for paricipating again! I promise to keep doing these contests...it's so much fun, and I feel like all of us walked away having learned at least one fact that we didn't know before we started reading the thread! 


:::::::::
Hello my favorite lovely pizza friends! Last week I had a contest asking for everyone's favorite dinosaur, and it was a hit! So my sister and I were talking this evening, and we wanted to offer another pizza, along those same lines.

So here is this week's contest: What is your favorite **fact**? It can be a historical fact, or a science fact, it could even be something about your favorite musician...the sky is the limit. Just do me a favor and link to an article (even from Wiki) that provides some proof about your fact. One of the best things about last weeks contest was reading about so many critters I had never even heard of. 

So for example, my fact is one that was posted here on Reddit a few days ago. Apparently one out of every six stars has it's own Earth sized planet in orbit around it! That...is amazing. [Here's](http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/2013/pr201301.html) the article in case you missed it: 

My [sisters'](http://www.reddit.com/user/losermedia) fact is that a cats purr vibrates at a level that actually has healing properties towards humans! [Here](http://consciouscat.net/2009/09/14/the-cats-purr-a-biomechanical-healing-mechanism/) is a brief article about it.

To make sure this contest gets some momentum, we're going to wait to pick a winner until Sunday afternoon. And please feel free to duke it out and discuss why your fact is the **best** fact! Keep it civil though, hehe. 

This contest is for the USA. And if you're the winner, you will be to chose from one of the big 3! Unless of course you have a local spot that will accept GC purchases from their website.

5661,"So, I've been posting and lurking around loseit/fitness forever talking to people and sharing my adventures and advice based on my findings with my fitness (Not weight loss, fitness) journey. So I've decided to take a slightly similar picture to one I knew I had from before I started working out and watching my calories like I do now to see a side by side comparison.

First picture, I was near 300lbs if not still over it. Second picture I'm down to around 215, If I haven't already dropped slightly below it!  (Totally trying to make a half-assed tired smile in the new picture, this was taken right after my first 20 minute HIIT kettlebell workout)

http://i.imgur.com/IUGuV.jpg

Started with just bike riding; then moved into bike riding + resistance bands. Then bike riding+ resistance bands + bodyweight excercises. I'm now doing kettlebell HIIT; which for cardio simply blows away my bike riding; also working muscles in my core/back that I hadn't touched before! 

....taking a second look at both pics; I have second thoughts of posting; but whatever. :/

**Hope everyone is staying motivated and working towards their goals!**

(Aside: I'm about 6' even, my diet consists of ""normal"" food, I'm not taking anything strictly out of my diet; so I eat as I would, but I count calories and stay WAY below my maintenance amount, by sometimes up to 1000 calories a day. Though at home when I do cook, it always Chicken, Fish, Turkey, or pork chops with veggies)












[EDIT IN]
Started out with a bad break up; started looking at things that were wrong with me. Spent about 8 months beating myself up; fixing and changing my personality (I was a complete asshole then). 

THEN suddenly decided to start riding my bike; for no reason, just for getting fit I guess. Kept at it. 

At some point my buddies at work started talking about eating right and getting fit; so I decided to into full blown.

SOOO then, during workouts; I would use anger early on to push myself to keep going. After so many mornings of looking in the mirror and thinking that you're seeing the same thing every time, you have to let go of the anger and start to think logically.

I knew I was working out, I knew I was eating less; so I HAD to be making progress. I've stuck with this mentality and you start noticing small things changing, the way your legs change shapes when you sit or stand, how your bicep looks when you're brushing your hair. Your clothes becoming more and more loose! (Great and bad at the same time with the clothes, cause now you gotta buy more clothes!)

Losing weight/gaining muscle mass is about noticing the little things and appreciating them. Because you can only do so much as one time. 

Also an important thing to remember when you're working out, or thinking about your work out. Your mind will ALWAYS give up before your body. I think of excuses to skip a workout just before I start, up until the first rep I'm thinking of excuses to skip. Even while working out I start thinking ""that's enough, you've done enough, you did this much last time!"" You just have to fill your head with positive reinforcement, and pump your self up. I was literally calling myself a warrior in my head today when I was doing my swings; just to keep myself motivated! The human body is a very incredible thing and no matter how out of shape you are, it can probably keep going long after you've passed out!

Please what ever you do if you are struggling with trying to commit to keto and changing your life style do it. Do not end up like me. 

  Due to how heavy I am I do not possess a scale that goes high enough to weigh me. I will be going into the dr's office later this month to get re-weighed. I cant weight but am terrified I will be disappointed at my progress. 

Now for the seasoning warning. While shopping I was searching for seasoning to use on my meat, and I started to check the ingredient list on some of the all purpose and combination seasonings.

5687,"It is not an easy question to answer.  To be honest, I am still not totally sure.  Bear with me for a moment, what I am about to say may sound shockingly familiar.

I started smoking in my late teens, pot I mean.  Back in highschool I was always anti drug.  Drugs seemed to be such a waste of time.  If I wanted to relax, all I had to do was crack a book or geek out on a videogame / film.  Life was awesome.  Drugs just seemed like such a drag and the people who used them seemed so unbalanced / immature.

Innocence is funny, when a person has it they want to defile it but once its gone, getting it back takes decades of active forgetting.  Anyway, an older nerd got my lan group into weed.  Pretty soon no one was gaming at lans, everyone would run out to hotbox a car and then they'd come back and look at videos or dick around on the internet.

All of this was annoying, and this older guy would just not stop abbout the benefits of weed. no withdrawal, not possible to be addicted, perfect drug, we have all heard these lines.  my young adult brain starts whirring.  i could just try weed once, then i would immeditaely quit and i could prove how lame this drug is.  

to say i was / am naive is an understatement.  I tried to research things as best I could, but back then no one had done any research on ""cannabis state dependence.""  What my friend didnt know, is that marijuana is almost worse than a pure physical addicion.  A person can have blood levels of some of the metabolites THC breaks down into for months after even a single hit.  These metabolites can result in reality feeling duller than it actually is.  The pothead. mistakenly thinks he is sober just because there is no thc in his blood, instead there are insane levels of 11-OH-THC, 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC, and a hundred others.

I am writing this post well over a decade later.  I am nearly 30 years old.  In between those unsure first steps with cannabis, and now, when I am throwing out over a half ounce, a bong, and a volcano, much has transpired.

This is not my first attempt to quit.  I can think of eight serious attempts and countless less effective tries.  I have quit for women and school and G.  I have quit to get better jobs or prove things to myself or for art.  These 8 attempts all lasted over a month, and the longest two attempts lasted over six months.

My friend was right about one thing - marijuana never ruined my life. I got through school, and now make bundles of money.  I am successful, happy, life is good.

So why am i quitting?

The biggest danger of marijuana use, aside from the false sober, is the longterm result of spending a decade playing dexters lab with one's brain.  I remember being a kid and not needing an excuse to feel good.

I have plenty of reasons to quit:

* Clarity
* Concentration / Focus
* Patience
* I am never sober, just high and less high
* Finances
* It runs out
* Sketchy people
* Disrupts natural ways of being happy and feeling good
* Consistency / Responsibility / accountability / reliability / maturity
* The cycle of high / sober shrinks my world via dependency - too much playing it safe
* Work performance
* Wrist hurt from grinding
* I always want to quit after i toke, its like weed itself is asking me to take things to the next level
* Its a lot of work / time to get high, get the stuff, grind, toke, smoking a couple bowls can easily take 30 mins to an hr
* Getting high is predictable and quite honestly boring.
* Simplicity - I did just fine before weed

I want to learn patience, to be able to work absorbed all day in something without also having to feed the beast.  When bad things happen, I want to meet them head on and wits about me.  When good things happen, I want to savor those feelings just as they are.  When I am lost in the doldrums aka the meat of life, I want to have the grace to smile and deal with the tedium constructively.  Mostly I just want to be myself, lucid, clearheaded, flaws, faults, and all.  Life is illusion enough as it is, no reason to further deceive myself.
 
I have a friend who has never even wanted to try any drug.  I asked him about this, he said ""I have never tried drugs because A) My mom did tons of drugs growing up and she would tell us stories of all the drugs she tried and they all sounded lame, and b) when I was in highschool I used to hangout with the stoners, and they were always bugging me to try. I started asking them ""is it the best thing in life?"" no one ever said it was so what am I missing out on? dry eyes and sore lungs?""

Anyway, time to throw somethings out.  Imma pull up a chair and hang around.

""My peers, lately, have found companionship through means of intoxication - it makes them sociable. I, however, cannot force myself to use drugs to cheat on my loneliness - it is all that I have - and when the drugs and alcohol dissipate, will be all that my peers have as well."" - Franz Kafka

And for the techies - someone asked on y combinator if mj helps with coding.  A few anons said maybe, but the #1 response:

Not me. I'm of the opinion that lighting things on fire and sticking them near your head to breathe just sounds like a bad idea all the way around.

I'm for legalization though. The idea of outlawing a weed that does less harm than alcohol is ludicrous.

I experimented a bit as a teenager. As I recall, it didn't help my analytical skills at all -- unless by analytical skills you mean finding doughnuts at 3am or being able to smile stupidly while listening to Led Zeppelin tunes.

I think intoxication is a natural state of mankind, so if you like toking or drinking or running until endorphins seep out of your ears I can understand that. I just don't think any of that, no matter how good it feels, actually makes you a better coder. If anything, I think good coders learn the natural rhythms of their bodies and minds, then maximize their performance based on that.

Now can it make you think you're a better coder? Sure thing, boss.

I'm looking to see what your favorite songs have been to play and learn. With the month I've had my bass so far (gotta love Christmas), I've been learning material from some of my favorite bands as well as some theoretical things. I'm always looking for new sounds and kinds of music.

With that said, what's been your favorite songs to learn and your favorite artists to learn from? I've been having fun listening to some older Metallica, Rush, Led Zeppelin and am currently in the process of willing my fingers to play freewill. It's been difficult but a whole lot of fun too!"

5695,"Hi reddit - this is my first post!

I've been leading a healthy lifestyle for about 9 months now and have lost around 35 pounds. I've done the obvious - changed my diet and starting exercising, but what other tips or advice can you share that may inspire or encourage someone to lead a healthier lifestyle?

My tips:

1) Drink water. Most importantly, drink as much water as you can immediately before a meal. This will help satisfy your body into thinking you are full before you consume too much food.

2) Find something or someone that motivates you and think of the fall out if you continue your unhealthy choices. I am always thinking of my family and daughter as it helps me want to be healthy and live longer. 

3) Understand that losing weight takes time. The recommended weight loss rate is around 1lb a week. It is so much easier to gain weight than it is to shed the extra pounds. Remember that 1lb of fat is equal to around 3,500 calories!

Thanks for reading!"

[Before](http://i.imgur.com/31y6dHK) 

[Current](http://i.imgur.com/H0rZM2V) (taken today, same pair of jeans)

I have been heavy since I was in middle school, I played sports which kept me active but I was always big.  When I stopped playing sports Junior year of high school I started to gain serious weight.  I never weighed myself because I told myself I didn't care what I looked like.  That went on until one year ago today.  I was recently out of a bad relationship and after seeing a friend was on a weight loss plan it just hit me like a ton of bricks.  ""Why can't I do it?""  I threw on a pair of shorts and went and ran on the elliptical for 12 min, that's all I could handle haha.  I weighed myself the next week to see my start weight and the scale read 299.8 lbs.  After a couple days I decided that a round number of 100 lbs sounded like a good goal.  Some people (including my parents) thought this too ambitious and to set an easier goal.  That only pushed me harder.  I downloaded MyFitnessPal (Chard43) and started counting calories.  I ran on the elliptical to start because I had flat feet and wore orthotics in my shoes and couldn't take the pounding of regular running.  I eventually moved onto P90X and continued the elliptical.  I used that program to get me down to about 240-250.  I started to notice I had some real strength so I decided to move on.  I started running outside and doing the workout program Insanity, and realized I needed new running shoes.  When I went out and got a pair I bought ones with proper support in the shoe (Brooks GTS 12's, I love them).  I started running and working out without orthotics!!  This was huge for me, as I'd been wearing them since the beginning of high school and found even walking without them uncomfortable, but I had since rebuilt the muscle in my feet and legs that I no longer needed them.  For a 6'1'' male severely obese is 302lbs, which is basically where I started.  When I dropped below 225 I moved out of Obese.  And to no longer be Overweight, it says I need to be under 190, so that's my new goal.  I still do Insanity and run outside with my new wonderful, beautiful, amazing girlfriend!!  I have been reading this subreddit since a friend turned me onto it a couple months ago after she saw my weight loss.  I figured it was my turn to share.  It just feels great to be comfortable with how you look, I have never been happier!

5713,"I have my bags packed.  The appointment with the new therapist is at 11 am, four hours from now.  Four hours to get through.  I haven't slept, but I've smoked around 15 cigarettes tonight, until I threw up coffee (I can't eat).  I know if I don't go today, I won't make it to the end of the month, or maybe even the week, much less the semester.

For the first time, I'm going to come clean to this therapist.  I'll admit that the mood swings are getting worse, more defined: when I'm manic, I can't sleep, I can't catch my thoughts as they swirl all around inside my skull, I'm compelled to talk and be witty and make everyone love me.  Or instead I'll get so frustrated in the Starbucks line that I'm two minutes from screaming and attacking everyone for being so fucking stupid.  When I'm depressed, I lay in bed for hours and cry and fantasize about suicide.  The only plans I can make are to kill myself.  I have dozens of drafts of suicide notes lying around.

I will also tell this new therapist that I've been hallucinating for almost two years now.  I've only told one other person because of the stigma and because it's solid evidence that I'm slowly and surely losing my mind.  

I won't tell anyone where I've gone, and I know they'll take my phone when I get in because they put me there before when I chased a bottle of lithium with a bottle of whiskey.  With any luck, no one will notice until it's time to start drinking on Friday, because I'm a staple in that activity.

I'm supposed to graduate with a Bachelor's degree, a major and a minor like some sort of fucked up song, in May.  But that's difficult to do when you can't make it to class half the time, or you walk around campus audibly hating everyone, or the Ghost appears behind you or next to you and you don't believe in ghosts so what could it be?

As long as I make it through these fours hours, I can safely hide away from the world until I have shaven into new mirrors, until the the wound is stopped or opened

forever.

UPDATE: Thanks so much everyone!  They diagnosed me with OCD and PTSD while I was in there, along with the old Bipolar NOS diagnosis.  I'm doing a lot better, and I actually made some really good friends.  I've done almost a complete 180 from where I was last week.  I know it won't stay like this for too long, but it's better than the other option."

5716,"**TL;DR below, but this is worth reading.**

I have relapsed many times before. I have started nofap over and over again. But I finally made it this far, 40 days, and I'm going to stay on nofap for awhile, at least 3 months. So what changed for me this time that I was able to stay with nofap?

Well, I am going thru a lot in my life right now. Trying to find work and income is so important right now that it occupies my mind almost constantly. In the past, I would use fapping to provide temporary instant relief, but I fapped so much that I got erectile dysfunction. I couldn't get a hard-on to save my life. That scared the fuck out of me, **LITERALLY!**

So, now I had an additional incentive to stop fapping. With the stakes so high, I knew I had to stop. So I focused on more important things, and focused my mind on a higher level. A level where I keep my long term goals and rewards in mind, and not focus on the temporary relief and satisfaction of fapping.

Albert Einstein said: ""We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them."" We must think on a level above the problem or else we stay in the same mentality of the problem, and we are doomed to fail.

If we stay on the same level as ""fapping is pleasure and satisfaction and relief, but I should try to stop it"", then we are still doomed to failure. This level of thinking is not good enough. But if we take our entire mentality to a higher level, then we do not even consider fapping to be an option.

Here is an example: 

**If a rich person offered you 1 million dollars if you could stop fapping for 6 months, could you do it? Of course, you could stop it for a million dollars.**

How about another example: 

**If a psychopath told you: ""If you don't stop masturbating for 6 months, I will kill everyone in your family."" Could you stop fapping then?** 

I would hope so, for the sake of your family.

So what does that mean? It means there is no REAL reason that you can't stop fapping.

You don't need a million dollar reward to stop fapping. You don't need to have the threat that your family will die if you keep on masturbating. The real tangible and intangible rewards are worth more than a million dollars to you. 

**SO STOP BULLSHITTING YOURSELF!** 

Stop playing in the mentality that you are weak. You are not. If the stakes are high enough, you can and will stop masturbating. Raise your mentality to this level of thinking. It's time to get tough on yourself. The stakes are too high. 

Maybe you need to bring out and listen to the tough coach (or drill instructor) in your mind and let him guide and train you. If you don't have a tough inner coach, then create one in your mind. This inner coach doesn't let you make excuses. He won't let you be weak. He is always there with you and won't stop hassling you until you succeed in achieving new behaviors and habits. He is your tough love.

If you are struggling with nofap, you are just not feeling and realizing that the rewards are important enough for you to stop fapping. Consider and understand that the long term rewards of nofap are more important than the immediate temporary relief that fapping gives you. 

The solution to the problem of fapping is that you are trying to solve it on the level at which the problem was created. This is doomed to fail. You must take your thinking to a higher level and see the long term horizon, where you see yourself as a new person that is in control and now has all the benefits of being a sexually healthy, confident person. 

If you engage in this higher-level thinking for long enough, it actually changes your behavior, and that changes your habits, and then that changes you as a person, from the way you are now, to the better person you want to become. This is how ALL permanent, long-lasting change occurs.

My erectile dysfunction went away after 30 days. I have had sex twice in the last 10 days and I was so proud of my boner that I had to laugh at myself. 

**TL;DR - Nofap works. The benefits are well worth it. But you must make the stakes high enough for you to succeed.** 

**You must replace your current mentality with a higher mentality that supersedes and overcomes the temptation of instant gratification by replacing your low, animalistic urges  with higher thoughts of long term goals and rewards. and keep that in your mind over the long term.**"

5730,"So I've been perusing r/loseit; r/fitness, etc for a couple of months now and I've debated back and forth between various workouts and diets, but I was wondering if I could get advice that's a bit more tailored to me. I'm 5 feet tall, about 106 lbs and in decent shape, so I do exercise regularly. My goal is to shed more fat; I have a tendency to accumulate fat in my stomach, face, arms (which my mother says is genetic and that I will never be able to lose, and to some degree, I can't deny inheritance). From the posts that I've read, what's generally suggested is to modify one's diet. I eat decently well; my typical day is:


Breakfast: 1 serving of oatmeal + 1 serving of flaxseed + a source of protein (e.g an egg)
Snack: 1 large banana
Lunch: 1/4 cup of brown rice, 2 cups of some sort of steamed vegetable (either kale, collard greens, broccoli, peas, spinach etc), and 3 oz of protein mostly either chicken or tofu
Snack: some sort of fruit
Dinner: 1/2 cup of whole grain, fish, and 2 cups of some sort of steamed vegetable


Yes, I do have cheat days here and there. I've been reading a bit on keto, but basically I cannot engage in any eating guidelines that eliminates grains from my diet because.... well.....I struggle with regularity (again inherited). I have to eat certain foods otherwise I have zero colonic motility (yikes how embarrassing). Along that line, I can't switch out certain meals to add more protein because being 5 feet tall, I only get 1200 calories a day if I want to be in a deficit and again, I need grains and lots of vegetables to help me along. 


It may sound like I'm making a lot of excuses but at this point, I'm so frustrated with both problems. Does anyone have any suggestions on anything that could improve the fat loss and/or the colonic issues? Thanks!!!"

5733,"So just as a disclaimer, this project realistically would most likely never get off the ground. This is more of design exercise and a way to get this idea out of my head successfully onto paper and see how people judge it. Maybe if it gets enough traction I could work on a prototype, but that's a big if. This would be a huge undertaking for a novice programmer like myself.

With that being said, I'll jump right into the pitch.

If anyone is familiar with the game Star Flight, a precursor to Star Control and a major source of inspiration for Mass Effect 1, they'll understand what I have in mind.

The gameplay would revolve around the player exploring the galaxy and improving their ship's capabilities in order to deal with the increasing number of threats found in far flung star systems. The player would accomplish this through mining valuable minerals, trading with alien inhabitants (or defeating them in space combat and salvaging their ships), and discovering ancient artifacts from long vanished space fairing civilizations. Not only would players advance their ship in order to progress through the game, they would also learn valuable information. By speaking to aliens and discovering ancient ruins, players would learn about wormhole locations, where habitable planes are located, how best to deal with alien encounters, etc, etc. 

In a way, it would be similar to how Fallout 1 dealt with it's main story. If you were smart enough, you could go right to the ending areas of the game because they're open to you, but without proper training and learning information through the characters, you were dead meat.

And this is what I miss most about open world games. It seems like most modern games, while open, really rely on a start at A and go to B type of progression with their main story missions instead of letting the player organically prepare for the final encounters. Discovering things on your own was my favorite part of older open world games.

I have some thoughts on what the story would be, namely that it would, not to over mention the game, be similar in structure to how Fallout was structured. The experience of it, not the actual setting or plot. I'll edit this later when I have it better articulated, but I'd like to hear what everyone thinks. Is there a place for an old school open world game like this? or is something more constrained and player emergent gameplay, something like FLT, preferable to this?

EDIT: In my haste to get this posted I didn't realize that the core concept behind the game isn't terribly new. Hopefully when I write down the basic story premise and some more about the player experience this will make more sense."
5734,"I have been overweight essentially my entire life, not slightly but drastically.  I was raised on fast food to the point of eating out for lunch and dinner every day and always getting the ungodly huge meals even as a child and teen.  Dessert was not for good behavior but essentially a requirement after every meal..  I have never been sad about my weight nor was I teased for it much but I have always wanted to be healthier and participate in all the activities that I was held back from due to my weight. Losing weight loss has always been 10x harder not knowing how to eat/cook and never having a normal active lifestyle so I have been doing my best with what I know and can learn through sites like this and books..

So stats, I am 5'7'' and 25

My start weight was ~320 maybe a little more when I was at my biggest
My current weight 209! (yay)

What I am doing... working out 5 times a week, generally treadmill 45min-1hr depending on what I am watching. (movies and tv get me through better than music, if that doesn't make me sound like a couch potato I'm not sure what will...) and I do weight lifting 3 times a week generally with a kettlebell. I really like the Bob Harper video if you have never tried it, it sucks at first but I felt results quickly. 

Also I eat right try to stay under 1500 calories a day and most meals contain lean meats and veggies.  I have taught myself to cook which was not a great time at first but now I LOVE cooking healthy (thankfully hate baking) and I track my progress generally through pictures because it really is the only way I can see results.  

I am on here because I have never been this small and I need that extra motivation and accountability to get me through to my end goal.  I am doing this alone and have no experience with weight loss so anyone who has had success or has new fresh ideas are super helpful for me! I posted my progress pictures on /rprogresspics but here they are for those of you have may not of seen them, :)  Other than that any questions/comments/motivation/tips are welcomed :)

http://imgur.com/a/3w7pd

Also I say my ""Last"" 40 because 40 would put me at 169 I am decently sure I want to get smaller than this but I always said my goal was 170, once I hit it I will see what I look and feel like, re-evaluate and set new goals if needed.  Thanks in advance and good luck to everyone else on the weight loss journey! 

Edit 1: I should add though it may be deemed to some as a bad reason/motivation, I have been in this weight ballpark for awhile now I was happy with my weight and in some ways I still am but every relationship (except 1) I have had since being this weight has had the man in my life tell me I am too big or I really should lose a few pounds and my favorite ""you can meet my friends/family when you lose x amount of weight.  ""Friends"" have also told me that I am supposed to be the fat friend and are unsupportive in my goals to the point of bringing me junk food to eat... all of those negative people are out of my life but I still hear 3rd party stories of how hilarious it is to some of those people that I still believe I can be in shape or skinny one day.. I am officially peeved over it... personally I think I look pretty damn good but I do know and agree I could lose weight and when I am cranky I am more effective, so I want to get to my goal and flaunt all of this and what they threw away in their snarky faces. Well often times when I wised up I threw them away but either way time to prove some d-bags wrong. So yes helpful motivation and tips needed, I want to prove to them and myself that I can do it :D"
5735,"A while ago, there was a specific thread about how well known pros/streamers were able to climb the ladder by playing one champion extremely well. Recognizable examples are HotshotGG with Nidalee, Dyrus with Jax/Singed, Westrice with Akali, and many more. So about 6 months ago, I embarked on a quest to play just one champion a ton and try to gain elo. Whenever I had the choice, I would go for that certain champion. In this case, I chose Renekton. Why Renekton? Because I had a lot of fun with him and he's relatively underrated as a champion. Someone else suggested Riven, but I was having none of it, I had decided on the lizard wizard.

6 months ago, I was 1402 elo. So this was around August. Now, at the start, I lost a lot of games. I guess 1400 elo was too high for me haha. I didn't know how to play Renekton properly and during that small period where I was stuck, I almost gave up, but then I finally understood what was needed to be done. I climbed the ladder and hit 1500 elo AT LAST. It was truly all I wanted to achieve at the time, so when I hit that milestone, I started derping around, stayed in 1500 elo as I had no desire to pursue higher elo. 

During August, I met some people that were relatively better than me at the game... Specifically Dutch people. They would soon laugh at how much I spammed Renekton in pretty much every game we had and how I was the lowest elo of them all lol. I was 1500 elo and everyone else was 1600 elo or higher, so obviously, there was a skill gap. I would jokingly say to one guy that I had become kinda good friends with, Kasac101, that he sucked, and he would always have the same reply: Haha, you noob, get to my level 1500 elo scrub

I didn't like that at all :X So I started playing seriously again, and when I entered university, whenever I had the time, I'd play ranked or normals. I managed to hit a high of 1659 elo during September with Renekton and I was really happy with that. I had gotten to their level, though unfortunately, they were also playing ranked as well and hit 1700 elo, with some nearly hitting platinum. It was frustrating that I was consistently the lowest elo of them all. Eventually, I made the excuse that it was hard to carry games playing top... That was how I retaliated in remarks :P

Anyway, the end of season 2 was announced before I entered university and at the time, my goal was to hit platinum and get that shiny platinum border. Didn't manage to get it unfortunately, because I had somewhat given up after I lost a set of games that dropped me back down to 1550 or so. 

So yep, along came pre-season 3, and I started almost straight away at ranked with the goal of surpassing 1659 elo, a number that would be etched into my head over the winter season. I won my first two games I think playing Renekton and they had set my elo back down to 1440~ elo. After 4 games, I was back at 1550 elo where I had stopped at the end of season 2. I thought yeahhh, I'm gonna win these next two games and get back to 1600 elo. I was damn wrong haha. I don't remember the exact details, but I remember I was still at 1550~ elo after 20 games or so. Something like 2 or 3 wins ahead of losses. So yeah, I was like, damn, something's wrong, I'm so bad at this game lol. 

The same friend, Kasac101 (now known as Kassac (what a noob)), was gaining elo like wildfire and hit something like 1800 elo after 10 games or something dumb and did something he couldn't in season 2 - hit platinum. He couldn't get above 1899 elo though, but I expect him to pass that point sooner or later lol.

Anyway, yeah I was stuck at 1550 elo. I started believing less and less in Renekton and had this mindset that he was just a weak champion and if I played something different, I'd be able to reach higher elo. I kept first picking him, and was on par with other people, but could not fully carry my team. Again, I thought Renekton was a weak champion and that it's much harder to carry just playing top... same excuse over and over.

I gave up on ranked for a while after that, and continued playing Renekton in normals. Unfortunately, a real life friend of mine, Nickyg, who managed to get plat in season 2, played 10 games in a row in ranked playing Wukong jungle/top and got up to 1860 elo, and I was like wut? He was the one that introduced me to the game when I had nothing to do, and I should hate him for all the time I've put into this game :P Thanks a lot Nick. In a sense, I've always wanted to beat him in elo, as I had never gotten ahead of him my whole time playing LoL. During our 2nd 6th form year, he raced way ahead of me in elo (I was 1200 elo, he was 1700-1800 elo -.-). He has always been a goal when it came to LoL, and honestly, any other game we played together. I always had the same excuse - he played half a year earlier than me ;P 

Anyway, moving on. Nick stopped playing League, and I really didn't have that much motivation to keep playing competitively, as results weren't happening. Eventually, someone else by the name of Vicious Cahloh now known as Vicious Carrot, A.K.A. Carlos another A.K.A. Trolos is what I like to call him, played a few games in ranked and got ahead of me into 1600 elo... AGAIN. It truly annoyed me -.- 

So eventually, I stopped derping. I became serious. I started watching some streams, particularly top laners (Wickd mainly), and analysed what was the difference. What was the difference between a 1500-1600 eloer like myself, who plays top lane, to someone that's at 2300+ elo. WHAT WAS IT?? Honestly, I have half an answer. I am not confident enough to say I know what it is, because if I did, then I'd be right there playing against Wickd. I know part of the answer and I'm sure other people that are steadily gaining elo are also learning piece by piece. 

Either way, while having the skills is quite necessary, such as the farming, the plays, calling for objectives, warding, focus in teamfights, what to build item wise, masteries, runes, hell, what champion to ban, there was one key aspect I did not have. 

That was confidence. I did not truly believe I could dominate playing as Renekton. Only when I had the mindset that I would outplay and win the lane was never on my mind - just going even or letting myself get carried. I had this mentality because I had gotten fed many a time in the past, and some of them, I managed to lose. You know, those games where you are the only one that wins and your team is counting on you to make plays and win the game. I couldn't seem to do that. Also, I was unsure if my way of playing Renekton was the best way of going about things. Stuff like this hindered me a lot. Is 21/9/0 better than 9/21/0? Is it better to get Sunfire Cape before Bloodthirster? All these questions... I was never sure. Who do I focus when I'm this fed? How do I outplay them? I could never get higher elo with all these doubts of mine.

So what I did was scrap them away. I replaced my doubt with confidence. I can win this game even if every other lane loses. Let's take top tower and roam... Let's do dragon, let's do baron, let's ward their red buff. Eventually, I started to understand how this game worked at last. In the past, I never put wards down. Why I didn't do this was because I was never able to focus on both the map or what I was doing. That's why I never bothered. Now I do. I buy several wards and I keep myself vigilant. I am Renekton. I will make plays.

All this stuff happened after Christmas. It's good to know you have a new year to start afresh, and so my quest began... It began this month yes.

I was 1600 elo again before I knew it, and I started rampaging through this bracket. I was learning from my past mistakes, I put out a mindset of not raging at anyone and only blaming myself if games were lost. My focus improved. My laning got better because I now knew if the jungler would be approaching or not :P I learnt new ways of exploiting Renekton, and started using a mix of either 21/9/0 or 9/21/0 depending on who I was against. I made 3 rune pages for different matchups for Renekton (e.g. movement speed quints for when I chase fast pace champs like Teemo (I hate Teemu)). I started using either Flash or Ghost. All these little things have led to one thing: da el0z.
 
So yes, after a long passage of text, I will now say this; my highest elo was 1659, which was a pretty high number for me when I reached it a few months ago. Now... I am 1799 elo. I have managed to go past Kasac101 A.K.A. Kassac, Vicious Cahloh A.K.A. Vicious Carrot A.K.A. Carlos A.K.A. Trolos, and I managed to overcome my good old friend, Nickyg A.K.A Nick Graham who goes to Birmingham University (who Vicious Carrot hates btw lol). 

So overcoming them... that's a huge step for me, and I think I can keep going :P I am currently 44-25 and still gaining 15-20 elo... the system does not think I'm where I should be :P So what now?

I will put out this statement for everyone in the League of Legends community.

I will reach 2300 elo and face off against Wickd, one of the most recognizable top laners in the game, and (possibly) destroy him 1v1 with Renekton. 

When that time comes, I'll make sure I am the one officially known as the #1 Renekton player in the world. 

Thank you for reading and I will continue my pursue of high elo.

Oh and my Renekton win rate is 43-18, essentially 70% win ratio. This is all with my previous 5v5 team games (a majority I have lost with Renekton). 

**TLDR; I was 1402 elo 6 months ago and hit 1659 elo playing just Renekton in S2, dropped to 1550 before it ended. Pre-season started and I was stuck at 1550 elo for 20-30 games, got a bit down and didn't play ranked for a while... Then changed for the better and started powerhousing in January 2013 to where I stand on January 28th 2013 at 1799 elo. My Lolking: http://www.lolking.net/summoner/euw/20727686**

**Also, I have announced I will reach 2300 elo and destroy Wickd in a 1v1 epic matchup in top lane with Renekton vs whatever he  wants to play and become the #1 Renekton player in the world.**

EDIT: wow, I just put all this in Word and I wrote 1800 words -.- Dang, that's an essay xD

EDIT 2: Feel free to add me if you're on the EUW server.

EDIT 3: HOLY front page! We must make Wickd see this so I have acknowledgement :P YOU WON'T ESCAPE ME WICKD

EDIT 4: WOW, your support is really awesome, thank you to everyone that's added me :P 

EDIT 5: Again, thank you for all the friend requests. I also want to shout out to MrYoubs, yardhin and Mister Hide. They are some of the people I play with and aren't too bad at the game :P

EDIT 6: READING IT

EDIT 7: COME AT ME

EDIT 8: ""Guys, this guy will not beat me, he will not beat me..."" COME AT ME BRO!

EDIT 9: Thank you all for the help, Wickd saw this and now I will begin my quest to 2300 elo! Derp D:

EDIT 10: Aegge Aegge Aegge - felt like putting some Aegge here

EDIT 11: I'll make sure I don't let you guys down, I will GO FOR IT. Start tomorrow tho hehe.

EDIT 12: Another shoutout to TotalDigest and Raphon because I can :P

EDIT 13: OK, because Kasac101 aka Kassac is actually pretty good for a scrub, I will mention him again here l0l Oh and hi PaoPaoChan :3 AND MANGOCAT YOU FRUITANIMAL

EDIT 14: I give some love to Carpetfrog <3

EDIT 15: OK, just had my first ranked game since posting this thread and was a bit nervous :X but they didn't ban out Kha'Zix soo... do I need to say anymore? 1814 elo and let's keep going 500 elo to go xD"

5743,"I've always been an old music kind of person; most of the new music I listen to is by bands that made their best music decades ago. For example, my favorite album of 2012 was by Spiritualized and my only anticipated release of 2013 is MBV's new album.

All the resources I know for new music tend to be too pop for what I want: Pitchfork, All Songs Considered, honestly I can't even think of any others. I enjoy indie pop as much as the next guy, but it's just not the kind of music I devote my life to. Occasionally great new albums get discussed on here, but not with the kind of consistency I'm looking for. For instance I only learned about Swans' new record on here (I'm embarrassed to say I'd never heard them before, but they're quickly becoming a new favorite so thanks guys) several months after its release and I never heard it mentioned anywhere else.

Ideally I'd like some sort of podcast, but a blog or something along those lines would be great. The more directly I am presented with music the better.

Of course if you haven't already gathered I'm a rock kind of person (though of the experimental variety) so while I'm sure there's tons of amazing and innovative rap, jazz, R&B, and electronic music coming out this year, they aren't what I'm looking for."

5746,"I started NoFap in late September of 2012. I relapsed on 7 October when I... came in my pants. Since then I've been in hard mode with no PMO at all. The first two weeks was the most difficult ones. Then it gradually got better, and I got the confidence and assertiveness I've always wanted. [The reasons I started NoFap are explained here, so is a description of how my first month was like.](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/12se2k/why_nofap_is_the_way_to_go_for_me/) It was in that period I made out with a woman for the first time in more than three years (at around day 5 or 6). She virtually said to me ""You have such a positive aura! I think... I think I'm falling in love with you!"" Whether it was just dumb luck, or my increased testosterone levels, is open to interpretation. Regardless of the causes, it was a most powerful experience, and only the fact that she got blind drunk and collapsed in the bar stopped us from having sex that night. 

My professional life improved as well. [By an odd coincidence I suddenly got a new job](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/13cyl6/day_41_suddenly_got_the_job_ive_wanted_for_years/), a job I've wanted for years. An amazing set of circumstances were the cause of it: My flatmate works there, and her boss had been very eager to hire me for quite some time. However, my former boss always stopped her. As soon as my former boss went on maternity leave, my new boss was free to hire me without anyone stopping her. A couple of weeks ago I got another surprise call from my new boss: She offered me a one-year temporary employment which I accepted. When I finish my education, there's a very high likelihood that a permanent position will be available for me. 

Apart from the increased libido, one of the first changes I noticed was that my sleep improved greatly. My ""tossing and turning"" nights ended, and my dreams changed as well. They went from being sad and/or disturbing into becoming more pleasant and/or neutral. Whether it was NoFap or the fact that I had started lifting weights, I'm not sure of. Point is, I sleep better now than I had in years. 

Another aspect of NoFap was that my alcohol consumption decreased noticeably. Before NoFap I drank until I passed out. Now I'm perfectly fine being slightly tipsy - and I no longer have the urge to drink alone. 

As the days progressed, I became more and more daring when it came to women. Before I would never look them in the eye, but rather look submissively to the ground while fidgeting. Now I started looking them in the eye and standing upright, speaking with a firm voice. Once I flirted with a beautiful girl while waiting for the bus, [essentially eyeballing her into a giggle-fit](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/13q4p5/day_48_flirted_with_beautiful_girl_while_waiting/). At day 55 I yet again flirted with a friend of a former study buddy of mine, [a woman who turned out to be in a relationship](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/143hmb/day_55_randomly_met_an_old_acquaintance_and_ended/), yet still she was flirting too (and she never told me about the boyfriend herself). [At day 57 I got the phone number of a girl on my course](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/147j77/day_57_got_a_shy_but_cute_girls_phone_number/), however she later flaked out on me and I haven't seen her since. Despite my new-found confidence [I had to deal with rejection](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/14hqlx/day_62_dealing_with_rejection/), as everybody else has to. 

At day 67 [I joined a gym](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/14sldj/day_67_first_time_in_a_gym_in_almost_five_years/) for the first time in half a decade. Despite [an incident](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/15wg12/day_88_anxiety_attack_made_me_temporarily_lose/) that happened there, I still enjoy working out there, and I'm going to keep on doing it too.
 
Day 70 [literally opened my mind](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/14xqc8/day_70_epic_revelation/). Although the night started with flat-out rejection, I did manage to get in touch with two young women of which one of them appeared very interested in both me and my musical projects. That night I realized that the perceived hostility of women at night is just a defense mechanism to keep troublesome ruffians away; although they appear untouchable with a ""holier than thou"" look on their faces, in reality they're just as scared and nervous (perhaps even more) than I am. ""Night game"" is significantly more challenging than ""day game"", as women are much friendlier and more receptive in daylight. These experiences made me focus on having fun, not getting a woman. Getting a woman is a byproduct of having fun. 

At around Christmas I entered a period of low self-esteem and lack of energy and motivation. The most probable cause was a stinking cold I caught after spending an afternoon in my father's outdoor yakuzi. And the fact that I found [an unholy object from my disturbing fap past](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/15fac8/day_79_christmas_at_home_brought_back/). Christmas and [New Year's Eve](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/15rmre/day_86_new_years_eve/) were difficult times, and I was deeply unhappy most of that time. I'm still somewhat in the rut, but it's getting better every day. 

So now I've completed the 90 day challenge. The battle is far from over. Although I've seen dramatic improvements in my life, I still have a long way to go. There's a wonderful world out there and I try every day to be as much a part of it as I can. 

Good luck to all of you who've just started NoFap, or still haven't made it to the glorious day 90. And great respect to those of you who've made it way past day 90 and into three-digit numbers. "

It's easy to get all wrapped up in our own little worlds and have everything be content and going well, but every time I think about the grander scale, or hear stories on the news I get really put out.  I feel like it shouldn't get me down this much, but hearing about stuff like the rape/murders in India and Ohio, the school/mall shootings, the famines, wars, and all that other stuff really messes with my head- like the rest of my day and sometimes a few days are ruined.  I don't shut down necessarily, but it's really hard to go back to living a jolly, all is good life when you know things like this are going on.

I dream of one day becoming a dentist and being able to volunteer in less fortunate areas, but it breaks my heart knowing that truthfully, I'll never be able to fix what's wrong in the world, and will just have to sit by and watch all these terrible things happen.

Maybe this isn't the right sub for this, but you guys usually have good advice and opinions, and I usually try to fall back on my spirituality when I get in these sort of ruts.

> On the night of 17 January 1945, the Germans fled the city, and the students reclaimed the ruined seminary. Wojtyła and another seminarian volunteered for the task of clearing away piles of frozen excrement from the toilets.[19] Wojtyła also helped a 14-year-old Jewish refugee girl named Edith Zierer,[20] who had run away from a Nazi labour camp in Częstochowa.[20] Edith had collapsed on a railway platform, so Wojtyła carried her to a train and stayed with her throughout the journey to Kraków. Edith credits Wojtyła with saving her life that day.[21][22][23] B'nai B'rith and other authorities have said that Wojtyła helped protect many other Polish Jews from the Nazis.

> Pope John Paul II was an outspoken opponent of apartheid in South Africa. In 1985, while visiting the Netherlands, he gave an impassioned speech condemning apartheid at the International Court of Justice, proclaiming that ""no system of apartheid or separate development will ever be acceptable as a model for the relations between peoples or races.""[79] In September 1988, Pope John Paul II made a pilgrimage to ten countries bordering South Africa, while demonstratively avoiding South Africa. During his visit to Zimbabwe, John Paul II called for economic sanctions against South Africa's government.[80] After John Paul II's death, both Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu praised the Pope for defending human rights and condemning economic injustice.

I looked up the thing that was giving them the results, called ""keto,"" and decided to give it a try. Three months later to the day, I am 30 pounds lighter (146lbs.) and tons more confident.

It's summer and it's hot af, so I sold my R9 390 (for 150€) because it has a really high TDP. Now I'm without a GPU and I'm looking at used GPUs.

There are GTX 1060 3GB models for 150€, 6GB models for 200€ and I found a Sapphire R9 Fury for 169€.

I'm completely torn. GTX 1060 has way lower TDP, but I've heard that Fury can be undervolted fairly well. I also liked Shadowplay better than ReLive, it seemed to work better. Also GTX 1060 supports stuff like Octane renderer (I used Cinema for a bit, not much). But Fury for 170€ seems like a really good deal.

The other thing is that I have a weaker CPU (4690k at 4.5ghz) and I think nVidia has lower CPU overhead (dx11), which helps especially in games I play (DotA for example).

I currenly have a 1080p 80hz monitor, but one day I wanna upgrade to 1440p 144hz.

5820,"Seriously, xcom is basically terrorists now. I know they will have to implement something to make us hate them like concentration camps and people eating, but those cities look like good living, the scanners look less invasive than what we have now, aliens would probably fix a bunch of our problems, and the only logical reason for so much security is to stop xcom anyway. From what I see, they're basically romans. Vicious and conquering, but they also modernize the area and improve the standard of living. 

EDIT: Woah this got way more attention than I thought it would. Just want to say this isn't what I believe, just an interesting point of view to consider."

5822,"After reading Pandora's Star, I am driving myself crazy trying to remember another book that featured the concept of competing FTL technologies. I know I read it somewhere. Some people used wormholes to get around, others FTL spaceships.

I think that too often in a book ONE technology, one culture, will be all the story is about. But there's so much to be gained by pitting different scifi concepts against each other. Or even expanding it to fantasy (but keeping speculative) -- who would win a war between a high tech culture and a magic (with firmly established rules and limitations) culture?

Very selfishly, I'm asking for recommendations for books that clash cultures in this way. Pandora's Star does so within one culture, really letting it be the development of one core technology with the results being that first wormholes, then spaceships are the most cutting edge."

Does anyone know which is the most sedating kratom strain? I've heard it's red Bali.
How sedating and relaxing are they? Is it stimulating at all ?
I looking for help with sleep and anxiety.
I don't want it to be stimulating at all.
I looking for something similar to a benzo

If no kratom strains are not stimulating  does anyone know any alternatives that would be good?"

 I just love the whole story of most series, you know? Hard to pinpoint my exact favorite parts, because there’s absolutely too many. 

Anywho, just as the title suggests, what are your top five favorite book series?

Here are mine:

1.	Harry Potter - J.K. Rowling
2.	Cirque du Freak - Darren Shan
3.	The Infernal Devices - Cassandra Clare
4.	Percy Jackson and The Olympians - Rick Riordan
5.	A Series of Unfortunate Events - Lemony Snicket

Not necessarily in order, but Harry Potter definitely deserves that top spot for me.

Cant wait to see your take on the list!

5837,"I've asked elsewhere before and not had any luck, so trying here now. 
Years ago, probably in one of the many old sci-fi anthologies my dad let me read when I was young, I read a story. 
I've been trying to find it for years, and it's bugging me that I can't. 

I can only remember bits, and have found other stories with similarities, but not this.

It's from the POV of an alien Doctor (hence Google search have issues for alien doctor...) who's a torus shape, their species rolls for circulation. 
He's called in to try help an injured human, so we see our biology from an alien viewpoint.

I think there maybe telepathy, and it might even be underwater. 

I've found stories like Arena and Microbe that feature similar rolling lifeforms, so I know it's not those.

5846,"Five months ago I created Feetlot.com and [announced](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/x0l23/hey_mfa_i_created_a_website_where_people_can_see/) it here on MFA. If you haven't heard of it yet, it's a website that tells you how shoes fit when compared to other shoes.

Five months were enough to get some data, and, as I didn't promote it anywhere outside of MFA, the data we have should accurately describe the community.

**Top 10 popular shoes**

- [Clarks Desert Boots](http://feetlot.com/clarks/desert-boot) - can be compared to 108 other shoes; owned by 94 users 

- [Vans Authentic](http://feetlot.com/vans/authentic) - 71 comparisons, 54 owners

- [Sperry Top-Sider Authentic Original](http://feetlot.com/sperry-top-sider/authentic-original) - 71 comparisons, 55 owners

- [Converse Chuck Taylor Core Ox](http://feetlot.com/converse/chuck-taylor-core-ox) - 58 comparisons, 42 owners

- [adidas Samba Classic](http://feetlot.com/adidas/samba-classic) - 25 comparisons, 10 owners

No surprises here, CDB are the most popular shoes: they are owned by 25% of MFA. They can also be compared to 108 other shoes, that's a pretty impressive number.

**Here's some website stats:**

- Total users: 383

- User shoes: 827

- Shoes comparisons: 1,816

- Searches: 16,082

- Weekly visitors in October-November: ~100-200

- Weekly visitors in December-January: ~300-400

**How you can help Feetlot and MFA**

Feetlot analyzes user data. The more data there is, the more shoes can be compared and the more accurate these comparisons will be. If you find the site useful, please sign up and add your shoes and their sizes. It is now possible to sign up with Facebook (it's completely anonymous, no one will know you own CDB!), so the process should take only a few seconds.

Also, whenever you see someone wondering 'how do these shoes fit?', let them know there's a website that answers precisely this question.

5853,"I watched this movie on TV as kid, so my memory is a little fuzzy, but here's what I can remember:

The movie starts with the main character just kind of living his normal life.  I would venture a guess on his profession, but I don't really remember and don't want to throw people off.  At some point, there is a birthday party (I think for his kid) and while sitting there enjoying the party, he starts to notice ghostly images in the background.  They are guys in haz-mat suits, that seem concerned that he notices them.  Pretty soon, everything else around him starts to look like some sort of third-world country.  Everyone is filthy and wearing rags, and the food (perhaps the birthday cake) is rotten and covered in maggots.  He seems to be the only one who is seeing this and everyone else just thinks they are in a middle-class suburb.

Later in the movie, he meets with some scientists who live in the 2nd layer of reality who tell him that they are running experiments on people in town and they are responsible for the 1st layer of reality (kind of like the Matrix).  They do it to make the poor people happy and keep them from rebelling against the richer side of society.  This second layer of reality is set up for the elites and seems like a futuristic world compared to what the main character was used to.

The main character doesn't like this and tries to sabotage the scientists.  He ends up running from them and eventually comes across some guy who is running the machine that makes the different layers of reality.  He tells the main character about the ""real"" layer (3rd) that was designed by someone before him.  This guy just maintains the machine.

The last scene I can recall is the main character running away from some policemen in the rich society (2nd layer) and two cops tell him to freeze, guns pointed.  The main character turns around and sees the two cops as two guys in robes (think Buddhist monks) holding wooden blocks in the shapes of guns (3rd layer).  He smiles and runs away.  They open fire, but from their perspective, the bullets just don't seem to be working.

------------------

I remember liking the movie but never found out the name.  It reminds me a lot of the Matrix in some ways.  Like it could have inspired it to some degree."

We know there is still a system of employment and a monetary system still (people treating others at clinics and places of consumpation like bars) as well as people who broadcast propaganda on ADVENT.

Ultimately the cities do serve as a purpose of bringing in settlers or encouraging migration to the cities. Which dosen't quite work as there are slums also but the cities exist for the long term goal of the avatar project.  Till then even ADVENT has got to show it can govern.

5887,"I'm working on an independent web series, The Tale of Fray. It was a concept started in late middle school, and I kept working with it until it became what it is today. Somewhere along the way (I don't quite recall when) a few of The Decemberist's songs from The Hazards of Love worked their way into the story, both as plot points and to help highlight some of the archetypes in the story itself that were inspired by the album. 

Long story short: hostages kidnap a girl, and for the fun of it, they decide to make the whole situation a parallel to THoL's second act, from The Rake's Song to the final song. The ransom to get the girl back is for some of the characters to record themselves singing whatever song they've been assigned. It's simple, but seeing as these songs have influenced my story so much (from paralells with the abduction/rescue/drowning plot to the character relationships and some of the other classic fairytale themes like the shapeshifting, ect), I really want to include them.

Do any of you know how to ask for permission? I know The Decemberists have done Hunger Games, so I KNOW it's a total long shot, but I figured it's worth a try. At worst I'll get a ""no"" or get ignored, right? (though I'd like an actual ""no' answer more, tbh). I figure I'd email the manager, and I have his email, but I'm not entirely sure how to word it. Do I put it all up front, I want to use them for xyz and we can negotiate payment, or just let them know I'm interested in using their songs and then wait to hear back? I've done this, but only with indie bands. 

It's a non-profit series, 'for the art' or whatever. I don't know how that changes the status of things but I figured I'd share it. I first came across The Decemberists from a web series similar in format to the one I'm making, EverymanHYBRID, but I'm pretty sure they didn't get permission since it's a really REALLY indie series. And I know at least 3 theaters have put on THoL musicals, two of which are on youtube. 
I could /not/ get permission, but considering I'm trying to be professional, I want to at least try... This is just going to be a small youtube thing, not a huge film-festival-travling story, but...I don't know. I'd just feel better getting permission.

**TL;DR: I'm asking The Decemberists  to use The Hazards of Love album as a major story arc(s) in a series and I need help figuring out how to word the email/letter.**"

Then a year or so ago I decided to go in to a Goodwill with her, and discovered that most of them have a good sized book section. I I've found recent books, classics, hardcover, softcover, you name it. I've gotten books by Heinlein, Samuel Delany, Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, Walter Jon Williams, China Mieville, Gene Wolfe, Larry Niven, John Brunner, and many more authors I've likely forgotten.'m now an enthusiastic thrift store shopper. I even _suggest_ stopping at thrift stores now. :)

I've done and tried almost all kinds of advertising: TV, Digital, OOH, Concerts, Sponsorships, SEO, Radio, Influencers, Apps, etc... you name it.


I've seen product launches fail catastrophically and succeed. I've seen clients kill themselves to death through promotions, I've seen them build multi-billion dollar brands. I've seen them win Cannes and other kind of bullshit awards, and still fail at sales.


I know most of the guys here are interested in Digital Marketing, and performance marketing (lead generation, bottom of the funnel kind of marketing). But, some might be interested more on the branding, big budget kind of marketing (which is full Bullshit).


So, if you are interested, shoot.

To be as fair as possible, I'm comparing it with [the Cleo Alexa](http://i.imgur.com/H11lW6O), which definitely gives a higher, more gathered shape even though it's the least lifting of all my Cleos.

(Note: The wrinkling up top looks worse than it is because of the angle. It doesn't really bother me in any case.)

So I'm wondering: Is this less rounded shape normal with unlined Curvy Kates? How do you distinguish between a bra that just gives a more ""natural"" shape and a bra that is actually a bad fit?"

Tearing it down for that turned into re-insulating and refinishing the entire thing. Never one to let a project be finished, I settled on swapping out the thermostat with an Arduino + temp sensor + solid state relay. It's way more computing power than I need, but it leaves room for over-engineered future projects!

As for the software interaction: A Guruplug linux server runs a python script that polls the Arduino for temperature data & events once a minute. These are logged out to flat csv files (room for improvement). When the Guruplug's apache server is hit, php parses the most recent csv files and returns 3k readings, which are graphed with the HighStocks library.

Jeremiah's highest weight was 260 pounds. He slimmed down to about 210 for our wedding by cutting out sodas, counting calories and eating more vegetables. In June of 2012 he began following a ketogenic diet. As much bulletproof coffee as he wants, kale shakes for lunch and low/carb free dinner! He used a standing desk at his office for 40+ hours a week as well as doing body squats. He's down to 168 pounds and still losing. 

My highest weight was 312 pounds and I'm now at 145. I cut out carbs and sugars. upped my protein and limited my calorie intake. I followed C25K to start myself into exercise. I joined my husband on a ketogenic diet although much more loosely. He aims for 25g of carbs while I float below 100g. 

We have been a great positive influence on each other. We exchanged kettlebells for Christmas and are excited to continue on our path of health!


**edit:** Guys, thank you so much for all the positivity and compliments! A few answers to some reoccurring questions: I started my weight loss journey 02/2010.

They are pre-sentient with the earthbound trait and I can't get rid of them or even force resettle them to another planet. Any advice cause it seems strange I can't do anything with them.

And that's when it hit me; the beauty of Skyrim is making your own story, and nowhere does that manifest itself more, than in the wilds. You come across all these little events that just build up to make your character's story more and more unique. I suppose this has been done before, but it's always good to share stories from Skyrim, so go ahead and share your epic adventures, or your fleeting moments. Here are a few of mine on that one, single return journey, from Riften to Solitude and back:


________________________________________________________

**My Stories:**

On my way back, I took a wrong turn and stumbled upon a farmer and his wife wandering the roads. It was at this time that I checked my map and realised I needed to go back the other way. As I began to turn I noticed the farmer and his wife turn down a road I had just explored. 

This road led to Labrynthian.

Knowing there were frost trolls who would show no mercy to these helpless people, I followed them on horseback, bow out, ready to distract the trolls (I was at about level 12 at the time so I knew I couldn't do much more than this). The trolls attacked and the farmer and his wife cowered while my horse galloped into Labrynthian drawing no less than three frost trolls.

We rode up stairs and all around the outside of Labrynthian, trying not to be surrounded by the trolls. We headed for what I thought was a tunnel, but to my dread was a cave. I turned my horse, half expecting three trolls to be waiting at the exit (Keep in mind that this is expert difficulty and me not saving except autos and at the end of each play session). To my luck, they were still 20 or so meters away so my horse galloped through the entrance and we scraped past, alive and unscathed.

I then remembered the farmer and his wife and we rushed back to the entrance. I'm not sure they both made it out alive as I never saw them again, but never did I see any bodies, so I'd like to think I did my Ranger's duty.

Another story was of my short-lived companion, Meeko the dog. After discovering a small shack in the woods, empty but for a deadman lying on his bed, I read a journal presumably left behind by the man. It mentioned something about how Meeko was loyal and could take care of himself.

I exited the shack to find a dog which ran past me and into the shack. This, of course, was Meeko. I asked if he wanted to come with me and he began to follow me. As we travelled down the road, Meeko, my horse and I, I thought how fitting it was for a lonely Ranger to have a loyal canine companion.

These thoughts though - like Meeko - were short-lived. We came across a dark elf on the road who attacked us. Meeko put up a valiant fight, but due to my poor archery skills from horseback, I missed the dark elf and hit Meeko, putting him down permanently.

I think the shortness of the time Meeko was with my character made it all the sadder. I lay him against a tree, decorated his grave modestly and moved on.

After that incident, I knew I needed to improve my archery skill and had heard rumours of a camp in the southern mountains where a highly skilled archer called 'Angi' trained. After some exploring, I found her camp and spent a good day there training with her and her archery targets (by the way, every skill training needs to be like this, rather than just handing over money for free exp).

Whew, it was good to get those little stories down on paper... er, screen I guess? I also forgot to say, play on a higher difficulty (Expert or Master), save infrequently and don't reload games unless absolutely necessary. It helps make consequences more serious and really adds to replayability.

5994,"Hey guys,

Im looking for a galaxy spanning space opera, maybe similar to the mass effect games with (ancient) alien civilisations, ancient mysterious artifacts and a mysterious galactic threath. 

And/Or something like the recent prometheus movie where humanity discovers some kind of alien artifact and ventures out to the stars to make the first contact.

That dark mysterious ancient alien stuff fascinates me, any recommendations?
Thanks!"

5999,I'm just curious as to the processes and how long it took for the black hills to form. Such as the granite formations and the elevations of the hills themselves. Also curious how tall they used to be in primeval times. Not sure if this is too vague of a question though.
6000,"I'm aware that many experiments with basic income grants have modestly positive results, but if the Georgist thesis is true then whether we are talking about a Universal Basic Income or something restricted like Negative Income Tax, wouldn't overtime the surplus resources granted to individuals make their way into the pockets of landowners similar to how tax cuts  or increases in productivity are eventually pocketed?

If so, the implication for UBI  experiments that aren't funded by LVT seems to be that they will be counterproductive and will fail in the long term, no?

Elon Musk's UBI may save us from AI and Automation only to deliver us to the Landlords.  Shouldn't he be harping about LVT before UBI?"

6016,"One of my favorite things about scifi/fantasy is how one can create an entire civilization that doesn't exist. Many people brush over the logistics and laws of these fictional races, but I love it when pretty much EVERYTHING has been thought out. Social customs, laws, detailed histories... Depth is what I crave!

I just finished Princess of Mars and throughly enjoyed the Green Men's brutal customs. Another example is a lot of Ursula K Le Guin's works, but she was also focused on political commentary.

What other writers of science fiction have taken it upon themselves to build out lengthy laws and practices of their alien races? I posted this question on Quora a while back, but I specifically asked for films of this nature and didn't get much of a response. I've realized it's much easier to accomplish this type of depth in literary form, so I'm posting this here in hopes of discovering a plethora of intelligent alien species with their own laws and customs!"

6028,"As the title says. I read this in the early 90's: the aliens attacked humans after we'd spread out to found several colonies in nearby solar systems, wrecked Earth, and the whole human civilization collapsed.  

The survivors had to use genetic engineering to push themselves to adapt to new environments.  The moon colony survivors looked a lot like Grey Aliens, there were humanoid panthers, humanoid dolphins, hunchbacks with giant ears that had been enslaved and used as mounts by other species of aliens, etc.  

The main plot revolved around some humans trying to re-unite and crossbreed more perfected humans to help recover from the war and fight a resistance. The main character was the first one of those, and he discovered that the hivemind worms were enslaving the kangaroos and ended up finding the home of the mind worms and blowing it up.

Where it is definitely good to read as an inspiration and to develop your skills, do you think that reading while you are working on a story changes your style and, for lack of a better word, messes up your story?

I like this because we get to choose the sort of pop we want to support based on their ethos. They could be representative of us or maybe not. I think this along with event chains would be a cool thing for an expansion later on because of how much depth you could go in role-playing these kinds of scenarios.

6033,"I'm an estimator / designer working on an EWP (engineered wood product) takeoff for a multi family housing project. this project is near San Francisco, so I'd imagine seismic values are pretty high. 

often times EWP will be used as blocking between floor systems at a hold down. In some areas of this project I'm working on, the Engineer specifies holdowns. In other areas he specifies ""T"" and ""C"" values at the ends of shearwalls, which I assume are in kips - are these simply tension and compression values? [here's a couple screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/o70QI). Is this to simply communicate to the plan checker that the shearwall capacity alone will suffice and no hold downs are needed? 

If these values are tension and compression values, I don't grasp how these translate to uplift. I'm studying CE and would appreciate a little more understanding about the way this engineer has dealt with this building's lateral analysis. (I'm taking statics next semester, so I have a lot to learn).

6035,"I live in San Francisco. Due to my place in one of the most liberal cities in the United States, I am spared a lot of the ignorance and conservative viewpoints prevalent in many other parts of the country.

Today in Union Square the World Life Organization had a HUGE stage up, complete with a big screen tv flashing pictures of dismembered fetuses. I couldn't help but stare at the crowd of 200, the weepy women going up and saying how they could never abort, the MAN on the microphone.

I started shaking, my heart beat faster. Finally I stormed up to the front, and asked if I could say something.

He was obviously hesitant, and finally got one of his accomplices to hold the microphone while I spoke; I guess he was scared I would run off with it?

""Have you ever had an abortion?"" I asked him.

""No.""

""We'll I have,"" I said in the microphone. ""I was young and not ready. I was preached abstinence and didn't know about birth control. I wasn't ready to bring a child into this already-overpopulated world. I aborted, and I'm here to say I'm FINE. I'm happy, I'm healthy, I'm beautiful. I work a great job and am in a fantastic relationship. I can't wait till the moment in the future when I AM ready to have a child. So I don't think you have any right whatsoever to speak about morality when you've NEVER had to make that decision.""

I walked away while he ridiculed me in front of the crowd. A few people tried to block my way, a few people shouted ""you don't LOOK happy"".

I guess I'm just looking for support. I just admitted to over 200 people that i had an abortion. It's been an hour and my adrenaline is pumping, I'm still on the verge of tears and I'm FURIOUS. I am all for freedom of speech, and I'm glad I live in a country where anyone can get on a microphone and preach whatever they want. 

Was I out of line?

Edit: wow, ladies, thank you so much. I went from feeling powerless and small to feeling like I did the right thing. Thank you so much for the reddit gold, whoever you are.

Also, as a disclaimer- I don't mean to sound like the fact that I live in San Francisco means there are no ignorant people, but most people think twice before protesting in front of planned parenthood, or making conservative political statements. Also, the fact that he was a man DOESN'T MEAN HE'S NOT ENTITLED to his opinion. But holding an opinion and preaching to a crowd about what I am supposed to do with a uterus he has never had is a bit different.


Edit2: I didn't post this to start a debate or get harassed via PM's. this is my main account and I'm afraid I need to make a new one. I have absolutely no desire to fuel an argument about the semantics of my speech- I had 30 seconds to spew out some feelings and tell my story in front of a lot of people. Sue me for not choosing the right choice of words on the spot.

And Jesus Christ, YES MEN ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE AN OPINION, even though they don't have a uterus. Okay? "

6039,"I just spent 10 minutes writing a reply to a post on /r/writing only to be told OP deleted it before I hit save. Normally, I couldn't care less, but there was some great discussion about disputed 'rules' for new writers in the comments. OP didn't like the disagreement and so deleted the post.

I'd like to continue the discussion about well-intended but dangerous rules for writers.

Here's the original post and a few comments from the original thread to get you started (don't worry OP, you can remain anonymous):

------------------------------------

I've learned a lot in school for journalism about writing in general, but here's the shit that works:

1. Never write a sentence with more than 30 words. ( according to a little birdie, only 5% of people who read a sentence with more than 30 words will understand what the sentence meant. Shorter sentences will reach more people. Never, not one word over 30, count them if you have to. Try and not worry about this during writing and clean it up during editing.
 
2. When finished writing anything underline all of the verbs. Next analyze each verb, best with a thesaurus, and make sure you're using the right one.
 
3. Use adjectives sparingly, and when you're finished writing underline them all and do the same thing you did with the verbs. Over-thinking the verbs and adjectives while you write can clog you up, that's what editing is for.
 
4. I'm going to say it anyway; active writing is very important. If you don't know what that is I suggest you google that shit.
 
5. Don't think of grammar as a strict set of rules, but rather a set of tools.
 
6. When you're finished writing anything, anything at all, read it out loud.
 
7. Know all of the parts of whatever the hell it is that you're writing. Break it down into small pieces.

8. And if you didn't already know this shit now you do. And remember kids: write drunk, edit soberish.

------------------------------------

So guys, what do you think is potentially dangerous advice for new and improving writers to take to heart?

What do you think of OP's advice?

Why is there so many associations getting pissed at wealthy people for buying houses and apartments in impoverished areas and making them socially mixed again.

I am personally on the fence, I understand the need for lower incomes to find a place and on the other hand I am very selfishly think that if this can do (for me, Brussels) a city better, why not?"

It turns out later on that the planet being attacked was being punished for war crimes in the past, but so much time and passed between then and now that without any records, they don't know anything about their crimes and think it's just random attacks.

6073,I been living with fibromyalgia for 2 years now. I have used every medication under the sun and nothing has been helpful. I started using medical marijuana and it has changed my life! The only downside is getting high. Anyone have suggestions about how I can get the benefits without the high so I can take it during the days I need to be out and about? Thank you
6074,"Firstly let me get the pictures out of the way. I included a picture of teh quads because I'm finally starting to get some separation there and who doesn't like dat quads?  
[Pictures](http://imgur.com/a/4DKo9)  
Now to the fun stuff, it's basically just copy pasta from the fittit FAQ, because that shit is golden, son!  
**Stats**  
5'11 290lbs - 6'0 183lbs. (I grew an inch!)  
**Diet**  
I simply counted calories, I started with a thousand calorie deficit for the first few months and reduced the extremity of the deficit as I went along gradually. I'm currently still running a 500 calorie deficit as I have about 20lbs roughly before I'm around 12% body fat. (Currently sitting around 19-20%). The biggest part on not giving up with my cut was patience. I lost weight pretty quickly (100lbs in about 9 months) but it still took me a long time to notice differences. The biggest key to trumping that fact was realizing at no matter what weight I was I was happy with my body. Happy but not content. I was just as happy with my face and proud of myself at 250lbs as I am now at 180lbs. I implemented cheat meals every Friday when I would throw down with the bro's and ate what ever I want within reason, as that falls in line with what a lot of people say here. My progress would have been faster if I had not done this but it is not as certain that I would have succeeded if I had not treated myself from time to time. I never punished myself for the days I slipped up as well, I'm human, you're human, we're all human and we make mistakes the key is not scolding yourself every time you make a mistake, and instead improve from the ones you make.  
**Exercise**  
For the first few weeks I began with easy cardio, slow long walks every night with my mother (Who has also lost 60lbs, GO MOM!) and then slowly started taking up more difficult things like running and skipping rope. I started out not being able to jump rope for a minute straight and wanting to vomit after running a quarter of a mile. I have since ran a 30 minute 5k for my local humane shelter. I have sort of laid off the cardio since then though, I just do a mile on all my lift days at varying intensities depending at what I'm ""feeling"". Which brings me to my next subject, LIFTING! Don't skip out on this, I did for a very long time and only since I have begun to lift 'this heavy-ass weight' have I begun to really see vast differences in myself in my body. AND THAT IS WHILE LIFTING ON A DEFICIT AS WELL. Thank the gods for noob gains. I hurt my rotator cuff pushing myself, so my upper body lifts are still pretty meager for 3 months worth of progress, just gotta suck it up and keep grinding! I started with Starting Strength but have since switched to GreySkull LP, because of the longer rest periods between each compound while still utilizing my noob gains.   
**3 months lifting stats**  
Squat 115lbs -- 185lbs  
Deadlift 135lbs -- 255lbs  
Bench Press 75lbs -- 130lbs  
OHP 60lbs -- 85lbs (Dem rotator cuff :/)  
Pendlay Rows 105lbs -- 135lbs

(ninja edit stats)

That about sums it up! Thanks for reading and stuff!"

6076,"I've recently started a Mistweaver Monk, and I've been reading about some of the abilities. I've checked around online and haven't been able to find a definite answer to a question that I'm curious about. If I use Renewing Mist, and let it jump it's full two times, and then use Thunder Focus Tea, followed by Uplift, what exactly happens? I understand that the healing duration of RM will be refreshed, and that's extremely useful on top of Uplift's already decent heal. But when I refresh it, does it only refresh the healing duration, or does it refresh the jumps as well? Essentially what I'm asking is, does it give me ~20 seconds of healing on three targets, or does it give me ~20 seconds o healing on nine targets? I'm sorry if this question has been answered before, but I've never really taken an interest in monks until now. Thank you in advance."

Nice move on Brin's part.  ""Kthsemenee"" as an analogue for Gethsemane, with appropriate sacrifices and challenges by the crew.

6133,"I am trying to find a good monitor arm to go with my new uplift 72'' desk.  My initial thought was to go with the Amazon basics $90 one, but after reading some of the reviews, there were people who said that it was not able to be adjusted to a tall enough height for best ergonomics when standing \(i.e. eyes at about 3/4ths height of the monitor\).  

I am 5' 8.5'', if that helps.

Does anyone have any recommendations?  Would love to hear what everyone else is using. 

Also, I have two monitors, and I am stuck between going with a dual arm, vs two single arms.  I do, however, lean toward the later for maximum support and stability.

I appreciate any comments.  Thank you."

Individuals of this species are now hulking murder-chickens, growing up in privation on a world of melted cities and enormous, still-glowing craters, each competing to prove themself as the strongest. Because there's only one way off, and it's to be recognized as being worthy to join one of the elite cadres of xenocavalry-backed gene warriors that I'm endlessly recruiting.

6144,"As the topic states, I've been hanging at the official forums some just for fun. Not in the beta myself, I'm interested in hearing how the various classes feel about the ability purge and how it affects your gameplay.

As a mage/rogue I haven't decided yet what I'm going to main, but if the mage-whine is anything to go by, I'll probably stick to my rogue. 

So what's your opinions? 

EDIT: Point is that a most classes seem to look at their own changes in a ""vacuum"" instead of comparing it to what the other classes lose. Would be interesting to discuss the changes in one thread."

If you don't know what upliftment is, basically it's when a more technologically advanced race/species/society helps another progress more rapidly/instantly in a scientific/technical/cultural/societal sense. In a way, it's the big no-no of Star Trek's prime directive. It's a frequent topic in Stargate (spoilers, see: the ancients/ori, the tok'ra, the tollans, the asgard, the aschen, and the tau'ri, all with varying stances/approaches to upliftment).

I'm looking for other stories that deal with it, either print or video. Hardness doesn't mean much to me. ""Space fantasy"" would pique my interest as much as hard sci-fi.

Biological upliftment wouldn't be terrible, but technological/scientific/societal would be prefered."

Couple years back, I started playing guitar because I watched Beck (No matter how much I practice I still suck). I play piano thanks to a bunch of different songs and openings that are found in my favorite anime series (with the help of my friend who is a piano tutor). I now train harder and workout better than ever because of Bakki the Grappler. The World God Only Knows has made me start playing and finishing my games more efficiently (I tried God Mode, to difficult). I also study harder thanks to many cliche anime situations that are held in high school. So what anime did you guys watch that made you try something new or made you better?

EDIT: Wow this really took off! I'll make sure I take the time read all of your responses.

EDIT 2: Lots of fighters, cooks, and musicians here. I'm blown away by the amount of people who were inspired by just watching anime, I'm proud of being apart of this subreddit. "

I looked into ikea Linnmon table tops but their quality is made of a cheap plastic, and I want something sturdy. I was thinking about buying some plywood and making my own gloss white desk but if it already exists out there then I'd rather go with a premade item.

6198,"Every book I've ever looked at that talked about the Pentatonic Scale describes as ""three notes, then two"". IOW, in the key of C, it's ""CDE GA"".  Play it that way and it sounds sorta dull.
  
My instructor last night pointed something out that I hadn't noticed.  Rearrange it like this:  ""ACD  EG(A)"".  The point of this being that here you can see that is the same figure twice - a minor third and a major second.  Try playing in the LH ""ACD, E(below A) GA"" and it will sound like some kind of 70s funk bassline. 

That little trick immediately made it easier for me to ""see"" the pentatonic in other keys. My instructor is showing me how when you play blues you can choose the play a pentatonic based on the root, third, fifth or seventh with different ""blue"" notes resulting.  This can provide a lot more color than just always playing C blues scale over C7, F blues scale over F7, etc. etc. 

Anyway just wanted to mention the trick because I'd never seen it before. My teacher is full of these kinds of little tricks."

6235,"There's still a lot of time for it to grow on me (in fact I used to be fairly neutral towards IWY before it grew on me over the many months/the year of its release) but as of right now, it's sitting at #6 for me. 


Stadium Arcadium, Californication, By the Way, I'm With You, Blood Sugar Sex Magik, The Getaway, One Hot Minute, Freaky Styley, Mother's Milk, Uplift Mofo Party Plan, RHCP. 

For me the main difference so far is that many songs on IWY sounded very unique and different from each other whereas The Getaway, I can't immediately recognise or (as of yet) distinguish a lot of songs from each other. I just feel like it isn't as instrumentally diverse as a few other albums."

What i am saying is that if you took life from a more romantic intutive and artistic way you may have a more difficult time accepting a materialisitc atheistic worldview (in an emotional sense not a practical one), wheras a practical logic oriented and scientifc oriented person may have an easier time accepting a materialistic atheistic worldview

I played druid up to 80, as both a tank / healer and have seen they have now split tanking / dps up further in the talents :(

I have the options to boost up my druid to 90, or a new monk and instead level my druid through the missed content at a later date.

Any advice appreciated!

Elizabeth Moon's Vatta series, Mike Shepard's Longknife series, the RCN series, the Honor Harrington series all could easily be set on wooden sailing vessels, and this seems to work out really well. There's a certain magic about tall-ships-in-space that make some of these series, that otherwise would be pretty cheesy, really fun.

I think, too, these all are a bit different than more epic space opera; The Expanse books or the Commonwealth Saga just don't have the same feel, somehow (not that they aren't great).

I'm looking for new space-ship series to try, but suspect I might be scraping the bottom of the barrel having already read the above (plus Bojold's stuff, Elizabeth Moon's Serrano series, and probably a couple others I can't remember).

Any decent company worth their salt would hold their hands up and admit they messed up, let everything stand and say enjoy. This has even been seen in retail when items have been wrongly reduced in price on websites and the companies have honoured purchases by quick and savvy shoppers.
 
More than likely they'll roll everything back, including everything earned legitimately, and anger pretty much everyone who has played the game today. It could very well be the straw that breaks the camels back for many who are already frustrated by a succession of foul ups.

I decided to build a pc myself instead of buying one which is already built. 
I dont have that much knowledge about which components work with MTB etc. 
I tried my best to research and to build a Beast Pc which hopefully will last for a couple of years.

CPU: Intel Core i7 8700 / 3.2 GHz Coffee Lake Processor - LGA1151

RAM: HyperX Predator - 16GB: 2x8GB - DDR4 - 3200MHz - DIMM 288-PIN - CL16

Motherboard: ASUS ROG STRIX Z370-H GAMING - bundkort - ATX - LGA1151 Socket - Z370

Graphics: ASUS ROG STRIX-GTX1060-O6G-GAMING - NVIDIA GTX1060 - 6GB GDDR5 - PCI Express 3.0 x16

Case: NZXT H440W New Edition Silent Ultra - Matte Black/Black Window

OLD PSU with 24 PIN and 8 PIN for motherboard and 8 PIN to Graphics

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Will all these components work together and will the pc startup or is the CPU not supported by the motherboard

When I listen to From then on I feel many of the tracks could have been put out by a lot of other artists. There's no signature sound. To me at the moment uplifting trance is becoming soooo boring and predictable. The production quality might be better than the 90's but the innovation is gone.

6335,"Faceshots from July, November and today: http://imgur.com/a/4rZuW

I have always had a really hard time with my own self image - distortions abound.  I close my eyes and I see my body the way it was 20 years ago, and I look in the mirror and I feel like I have the ugliest face for miles.  I mean, even as I write this, I feel the need to hedge with (""Not that I'm not pretty strange looking"").  Anyway.  The weight thing - seeing what I really weigh versus what my brain thinks I weigh - has always made it hard for me to look in the mirror.  And as a result, there were a lot of things I wasn't noticing about myself - how awful my skin looked, how much older I seemed to be looking.  

Losing weight has been good motivation to start paying more attention, since obviously I want to see the signs of progress as they happen.  So as a sort of knock-on effect, I've generally been taking better care of myself cosmetically as well as physically.  I don't know that I'll ever feel like I'm an attractive person, but I'm slowly starting to lose the idea that I'm an *ugly* person.

So posting this series of pictures is about the hardest thing in the world for me.  But it has really been so motivating for me to see the difference that my weight loss has made.  For full disclosure's sake, I'm pretty confident that I weighed a lot more than 306 - probably closer to 320 -  in the first picture.  306 is what I weighed in at on October 22nd when I first started seriously pursuing this whole weight loss thing. 

I don't have a current body shot, but hope to get one today, so if anyone is interested, I'll post some B&A body shots as well.

Background from previous post:

So I'm a 37 year old woman who started out at 306 two [EDIT: three] months ago (5'7""). I've tried different approaches to weight loss in the past, but have never been really successful at it - I'd usually just give up and binge on a pint of Ben and Jerry's and lament my malfunctioning thyroid and make excuses for myself. I'd think about all the awesome food I know how to cook - and the awesome food others cook for me - and hated the idea of having to turn any of that down. But when the scale ticked past the 300 mark at the doctor's office, I knew it was time.
I sat myself down and thought about my successful attempt at quitting smoking, and wondered what I could use from that in my weight loss efforts. The first step for quitting had been feeling ""ready"", and I definitely felt ready now. 

The second step was tackling everything one decision at a time. Every time I thought about having a cigarette, I pondered carefully over the ramifications of having one, and the potential benefits of not having one, and tried to identify why I wanted one. So for this weight loss attempt, I approached every food choice with analysis: was I hungry? Is an extra slice of cheese or an extra tablespoon of mayo going to make this sandwich really taste better? Am I so hungry that a regular slice of bread is really more important than a sandwich thin?

I used SparkPeople to count calories, and while I know it's not favored here, it's the one that works best for me. I have been pretty lax about counting calories lately, but feel pretty confident that I have been staying within my limits, mainly because I have a good idea of the foods I eat - I have the same 350 calorie omelet for breakfast most days, and a recurring cycle of 350 calorie lunches and 500 calorie dinners, with a bevy of 100 calorie snacks on hand to satisfy any cravings.
Every night when I step on the scale, I feel a sense of victory, even if it hasn't moved or has gone up slightly, because I know that if I keep at it, it will continue to go down. I know some people don't do well with daily weigh-ins but it has been probably the single most important source of motivation. Every time I step on the scale, I can see not only whether I've lost another pound or gained another 2, but a reminder that I've lost 18 [EDIT:  30!!!] so far without even really trying very hard."
6336,"I was excited to try having a species as Livestock for the first time. So I created a story of a race of herders who used their syncretic species purely as a source of food.

Well, I was greatly disappointed that there is virtually no benefit to keep a species as livestock. They get a flat ’produce 6 food’. **That’s it!**

No bonuses play into this. The ’Agrarian’-trait does nothing, ’X% Increased Pop Production’ does nothing. When they were chattel slaves they produced 6 food, and as livestock they *still* produce 6 food.

An argument to this is that they aren’t meant to produce food as much as they’re meant to *be* food. But why can’t there be special building that caters to this? Factories specifically designed for processing pops.

Of course you could add the ’Delicious’-trait to increase the food output from them, but it takes a long time to get there. I would’ve wished Livestock to be an alternative to Chattel Slavery. They can only produce food, but does so in massive numbers. Bonuses apply, but having livestock pops will greatly anger other empires."

I am a student at UIUC and had a startling experience today.  I decided I wanted to try to start a University Men's Center(we already have a Women's Resources Center on campus) and decided to do something about it.

I was told to see my dean and he totally agreed with pretty much everything I said.  I was really surprised at how closely his feelings about the matter mirrored my own.  He then told me specifically how to go about starting a group like that, who to talk to and what needed to be done to get it up and running.

He even got my information to give to another student who had come to him with similar ideas.

TLDR: College students, actually start talking to people.  You will find 
MRA ideas are common and you can make a difference.  You may even find support in places you didn't think it existed.

And this advice applies to everyone else as well.

I felt like the narrative was fairly descriptive of the planet, the way that dolphins interacted with humans and the starship, but from a plot point of view I felt like the middle of the book was essentially crew politics.

the last third of the novel seemed to be more interesting to me: all the maneuvers of the Streaker starship, the smaller dolphin ship, and the galactic alien fleets that were hoping to capture them.

my favorite aspect about the entire novel was most definitely the poetic dolphin communications.  

I also found the various religious and cosmological / world view of the dolphins and different races very entertaining.  

my question is: in what books do you find out about the significance of Herbie and the derelict fleet?

More generally my research is focused on the links and potential feedbacks between the processes that build mountain ranges (faulting, folding), the processes that destroy mountain ranges (erosion by rivers and glaciers),  the role that climate plays in both, and how the records of all of these interactions are preserved in the deposits of sediments that fill basins next to mountain ranges.

6421,"I've been trying to find the perfect fit for a while now. For a long time I was in denial about the size of my band/cup and I was squeezing myself into Lane Bryant balconette 44Hs. With a couple extenders, it was almost feasible (sarcasm here) except for the underboob spillage, side spillage, and sores it left on my breasts from horrible fit. 

I have attempted to size myself and I think I'm somewhere around a US 46K or 48J, I'm not sure. I have ordered some Goddess Kayla bras and Elomi bras, and they are adequate and at least seem to fit correctly. The problem is that past 44H, every bra type available is similar to the Goddess Kayla, which is not molded and has a pointy, old-school style outline and very little ""lift."" It creates a natural outline that might look appropriate on someone older. I'm 25. I prefer an outline similar to what the Lane Bryant balconette bra gives me - a ton of lift and a small amount of cleavage, rounded shape. Any suggestions for molded bras in my size range?"

6432,"Lemme know if I have something wrong and I can adjust, but I believe this is correct.

(Collector-(Champion+Battle Legend)-1)/(16x16x16)+(Breeder+Champion+Battle Legend)/(6x6x6)

Notes:  Numbers come from the badges of the same name.

This assumes even distribution of IVs.  They're not.  We've seen nesting Pokemon typically have lower IVs when caught at a nest.  Also, during the first few months(?), there was a weird glitch where wild lower Pokedex Pokemon were stuck with lower IVs while wild higher Pokedex Pokemon were guaranteed higher IVs.  Since you probably caught more Pidgey and Rattata than Dratini and Snorlax (Although we all caught lots of Eevee, right?), This would skew some long term players downward.

Hatched/Raid Mons have minimum IVs of 10/10/10.

This also assumes you caught every Pokemon you've ever raided.  You probably haven't.  But there's no real good way to determine this otherwise.  Since you've probably caught a large majority of the standard raid bosses you've completed, you *could* go into your Pokedex, add up the ""Caught"" for each individual Legendary, then replace the Battle Legend badge with that number and probably get closer.

Hatched Pokémon do not count towards the Collecter medal."

6494,"I'm looking for a SF book series with the following characteristics:

1. Follows (ideally)multiple characters over the course of multiple books
2. A decent amount of action (For Example: Starship Troopers, not enough action)
3. Somewhat space opera

So far I have found and loved (in order from my favorite to slightly less favorite):

1. The Expanse
2. Vorkosigan Saga
3. Enders Game
4. Zones Of Thought

The reason for my unusual demands is that I hate Singular books because I grow to love or understand a character and atmosphere in a book, and then it just ends and I want more. And I need action because if I'm not worried about the characters that I love, then the story isn't exciting. And I want the series to follow several characters, because otherwise, among other things, there isn't actually any risk of important characters dying, just boring red-shirt cannon fodder.

I hope this is in the right place, thanks.

These people simply do not know how to adult.  They are incapable of hearing arguments contrary to their own.  They are incapable of maintaining a friendship with members of the opposite sex who they've dated.

6523,"Hello everyone! For the past several months I've seen a ton of posts that basically go like this: ""I wish I had all the time in the world to play this game to see how far I would make it"". So I thought to myself, with the beginning of Season 3, why not try an experiment on those lines of thought.

This is what I did: saved some money for a new streaming PC, set myself a strict schedule for playing league and stopped college for a period of one year in order to do this.

I call it Project Challenger and I will be starting it today at 11:00AM (GMT). http://www.twitch.tv/woundarbloodcleave

At the moment I'm not high rated, just your average joe trying to succeed at what he loves most. I mostly play jungle ... and mostly suck at the rest of the roles xD. I hope this will make at least an entertaining story to tell at the end of Season 3. So let the experiment begin!

tl;dr - crazy guy puts life on hold for one year in order to play league like a champ.

6524,"In this series one of the last starship captains is revived by a ""rebel faction"" of the founders in an android body after what the founders deemed a ""safe enough"" period of time that the aliens are no longer looking for the humans. She changes her body to male to fit in better in the patriarchal society and in time develops a more male-ish personality. S/he acts from the shadows to manipulate countries into rebelling against the no technology laws in order to eventually bring humans back into space and bring the fight back to the aliens. "

6527,"As atheists, we come across questions like ""From where do you draw your moral standards from?"" or ""If there is no God, what do you believe in?"". Being what we are and having that point of view in life guided with curiosity rather than faith and belief, we don't believe in man-made long beard merciless God that will strike us from heaven if we do such and such. Instead, we think with our own head and come to conclusions after learning the truth rather than listening to other people like sheep. So I ask you, do you find it somewhat logical (even a small bit) that something bigger than us/our universe exists? Do you hope there is some higher force/external energy/multidimensional entity etc.?

Speak your mind, tell me what you sincerely wish for to be out there? What would define your idea of ""god"" if you ever come across one? "

Two examples from nordic lore:

**""Skogsrå"" or Huldra**
http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skogsr%C3%A5et
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huldra

A beautiful woman, sometimes naked, that seduces wanderers and hunters in the forest. Seen from behind, her true form appears, either hollowed out lik an old tree or ugly. In some parts of sweden its only a foxtail that peeks out from her dress that can warn her victims.
Can also give gifts from the forest, such as luck with hunting.
Steals the souls of the men she beds.

Also, this creature has a counterpart in the folklore of the coast, where she comes to sailors and fishermen and trades their soul for sex, luck with fishing and most importantly for the fisherman - the promise that the sea will never take him, no matter how horrible the weather.

To understand the implications of this story, you must know about the superstitions regarding women and ships that prevailed  for a long time in sweden. No woman where allowed onto a ship, even meeting a woman while on the way to your boat was enough to bring bad luck.



**""Näcken"" The Neck** 
A young attractive naked male, appearing in water streams, often depicted as playing an instrument, often a fiddle.
Is said to lure people into the stream, where he drowns them.

It is said that the melody of his fiddle is magical in itself, any human who learned to play it was cursed, as he would never be able to stop playing it. Any who dances to the tune, was unable to to stop, and they would play and dance until they died, or where lured down into the waters.

The tales also said that for the price of your soul and/or blood, he could teach you to play the fiddle as masterly as him. For this to happen, you would either seek him out by the stream, or according to some stories at crossroads. It was espescially likely to meet him during the midsummer festivities.

Wow, this is far more responses than I expected, very much appreciated. Now, seeing as I was lazy and tired yesterday, I feel I didn't write quite enough about ""my"" creatures - so I'll add some.

6542,"About 7 years ago I ordered a book called “candyman” thinking it had something to do with the horror movie from the 90s. Needless to say, it turned out to be a really trippy sci-fi novel from the 70s, by a man named Vincent King. I loved the book, and ended up getting another by him called “Timesnake and Superclown” which was.... even weirder. I found these books again recently in a box from my basement and decided to run through them another time. Have any of you stumbled into a book you ended up loving? One you probably wouldn’t have read otherwise? "

Topless: http://imgur.com/a/aaoEH

I posted a few months back but here is an update:

Approximately 190 days ago I met with a trainer for a free session after joining the gym. When the trainer asked me what my goals were I told him I wanted to lose 80 lbs but I thought it never happen. He said ""it can happen, you can lose that much weight with enough time"" So here I am, 190 days later, 80 lbs lighter and in the best shape of my life.

I obviously made some changes to my diet.  I don't count calories but I just kind of generally pay attention to calorie content in what I eat.  The biggest change has been portion control.  I do my best not to gorge myself all the time.  Also more protein, fruits and vegetables.

As far as exercise goes, currently I'm in a sort of generic boot camp/crossfit type class at my gym 3 days a week for an hour then I usually get on the elliptical for 30 mins after.  On non boot camp days I go to the gym and do either HIIT or a lifting routine from a workout app on my phone, followed by more cardio on the elliptical.  In the afternoons on boot camp days I usually run 3.1 miles with a group of friends (sometimes we go longer).  Then on Sunday mornings around 6 some of the same group go for longer runs of 10+ miles.

I know this schedule isn't for everyone.  I wake up at 4-4:30 am to be at the gym no later than 5am so I can bust my ass every day.  But this is what works for me.  Find what works for you and you can see similar results."

2) okay you know how sometimes you get a red light in traffic and you're like what the hell, nobody in the perpendicular area of the intersection is even there??? well imagine if instead of being on a timer, traffic lights were based on a complicated computer algorithm involving traffic pattern information, little tracking sensors on volunteer cars, etc.  so that they would know not to turn red at the wrong times and so they would optimize traffic in heavy areas to reduce congestion.  but with preventative measures like ""a red light can't last more than 4 minutes"" so that nobody gets too pissed off.  just a better traffic light system using computers."

6608,"Recently installed floating engineered wood over concrete subfloor for my condo. We left about a 1” gap between the edge of the wood and our ceramic tile for a transition.  The tile is a bit lower than the wood, so we got a reducer-type that butts up to the tile and will cover the gap

To make things a little bit more complicated, the condo features radiant heat ceilings, which means my downstairs neighbor technically provides heat for my floors. Their system isn’t even so I have localized hotspots where my floor expands more than others, creating some unevenness at the edges (the floor will raise up by <1/8” around hot spots)

What kind of adhesive should I use on my trim so that my floor can still expand /shrink and would be strong enough to withstand the uplift from my flooring? Should I make the transition “float” with my flooring (i.e glue to wood)? Or glue it to the concrete subfloor & tile? Or both?"
6609,"Hi, so I just upgrade my i5-4690k OC'ed @4.2ghz a couple days ago to an i5-8600k. After booting up Skyrim the game does feel smoother but I was wondering if OC'ing it to 5.0ghz would make a noticeable difference compare to just letting the CPU stay in Turbo mode? Since Skyrim LE can't really make use of the 6 cores.

Would OC'ing it to 4.8 or 5.0 GHz will make a noticeable difference?

He is selling the complete bike for 1500$ but also offered to sell the bike with the original Fulcrum wheels instead of the carbon for 1350$.

Is it worth the gamble? I'm totally clueless as to how good these chinese carbon wheels might be. I'm tempted to just get the fulcrum but if these chinese wheels are good I might take them also. I've googled a little and read good comments.

Any input?"

6623,"Let me start by saying I don't know if this has been asked before :) I remember when I was younger, my parents never really listened to music. Sounds strange but they never seemed to be very interested. One day, I saw on MTV (Back when it was decent!) this really funky music video that had these four guys running around in a video game world. Some years later, that memory game back and I looked up 'video game music video' which turned out to be the music video for Californication. This discovery sent me on a journey of RHCP becoming my favorite band, and which lead me to discover bands like the smashing pumpkins and all other kinds of rock and roll. It's funny because out of all my brothers and sisters, I have the most different taste in music and I fully credit that 3 minutes when I was 6 years old to starting this addiction that this kind of music has become.

He'll usually reply with something to the effect of ""Next thing you know, your bra size is going to be 26Z!""

Anyway, thought you ladies may appreciate the humor of it all.  If I get caught up in brasthelitizing, and mention my cup size to someone, they check out my chest in disbelief ""They don't look like an F cup!"""

We did this thread [last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/comments/2s6hpd/state_of_the_shoemaking_business_2015/) and [the year before](https://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/comments/1w1x4f/discussion_state_of_the_shoemaking_business_2014/) as well. Some questions to consider:

Which shoemakers are on the decline (in terms of quality, design, or simply from a business standpoint)

Which are improving?

Which have remained the same?

Are there any newcomers to the industry that we should keep an eye on?

What changes do you expect to see in the year ahead?

What major changes have occurred in the past year that have shook up the industry or will see lasting effects? Here are some examples:

* Viberg adds GYW capability
* Prices continue to climb as Meermin, Carmina, and some other manufacturers have the great price adjustment of 2015
* Truman Boot Co comes onto the scene in a big way
* PW Minor is sold to new owners
* The shell battles continue"

6708,"I'm a voracious reader of science fiction (mostly the literary/""social"" stuff), fantasy fiction, and historical fiction, with a healthy dose of YA and the contemporary literary stuff every now and then. I've read all the popular things-- The Hunger Games, LOTR, Harry Potter, Neil Gaiman, etc. The thing is, I read so much and so quickly that I need to read long several books at once to keep myself entertained. For example, right now I'm re-reading *Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell* by Susanna Clarke and *A Feast for Crows* by George R.R. Martin, as well as *The Rehearsal* by Eleanor Catton. **Can anyone think of a long novel or series that features SF/Fan or historical elements, well-developed (esp. female) characters, and passably good prose?** Bonus points for fantasy series with in-world details that aren't capitalized to death, or a really awesome central romantic relationship.

**Referee:** Mario Melero López

 

---------------------------

 

**Line-up Barça:** Ter Stegen - Semedo, Mina, Vermaelen, Alba - Rakitic, Busquets, Iniesta - Coutinho, Suarez, Dembele

---------------------------

 

**Match Events**

0' - [](#icon-whistle) Kick off!

2' - Iniesta with a cross in, Levante not sure who should clear it, but no Barca player near enough to cause trouble.

4' - Beautiful one-touch combination in and around the area ends with Iniesta taking a shot that's easy to save.

5' - Coutinho a bit lucky to get to a return ball from Suarez, keeps it in the area but has too many defenders on him in the end.

6' - Suarez takes a free-kick into the wall, Iniesta sends it back in for Mina who is well offside.

9' - [](#icon-ball"") **[GOAL! BOATENG!](https://streamable.com/g9cna)** Morales tanks himself through the defence, sends the ball in the middle where Boateng is completely free to tap it in.

11' - And nearly the second for Levante as Barca's defence is all over the place. Luckily the crossbar saves.

20' - [](#icon-yellow"") **yellow** Vermaeln, for a foul on Boateng.

22' - [](#icon-yellow"") **yellow** Bardhi, for a foul on Semedo.

25' - Coutinho on a run, finds Suarez, on to Dembele who has his shot deflected to a corner.

27' - Vermaelen intercepts a counter, but holds his hamstring, not good.

29' - Coutinho whips in a free-kick to the far post where Oier jumps into Suarez and gets the free-kick.

30' - [](#icon-ball"") **[GOAL! BOATENG!](https://streamable.com/7g4cf)** Barca down to 10, no one manages to get the ball out of defence and Boateng goes around Ter Stegen, crashes into Semedo and puts in his second.

32' - [](#icon-sub"") Pique on for Vermaelen (1/3).

37' - [](#icon-yellow"") **yellow** Boateng, for grabbing Mina's face.

38' - [](#icon-ball"") **[GOOOOOOOL!!! COUTINHO!!!](https://streamable.com/xfim5)** Pique in striker mode, drives the ball forward, Coutinho gets the ball, takes a few steps to get into position and bends the ball perfectly into the net.

43' - Barca pressing hard the last 10 minutes creating a lot of chances.

43' - Oier jumps into Suarez again and again gets a free-kick.

44' - Semedo goes down in the area, no call. Replay shows it was definitely not a penalty.

45' - On the other end Levante wants a handball penalty, but Pique had his hand by the side and gets hit by the ball. Good call by the ref to not give a penalty.

[](#icon-clock) **HALFTIME**

46' - No changes at half-time.

46' - [](#icon-ball"") **[GOAL! BARDHI!](https://streamable.com/rdul8)** Levante very quick from intercepting a ball to getting to the area and Bardhi is left with way too much space to score a beautiful goal.

50' - [](#icon-ball"") **[HATTRICK! BOATENG!](https://streamable.com/tr1nr)** Barca's defence all over the place once more as Levante walks all over them.

56' - [](#icon-ball"") **[GOAL!  BARDHI!](https://streamable.com/m1n4a)** Another counter, another goal. Mina, Alba and Busquets nowhere near Bardhi as he gets the ball and scores his second of the night.

58' - [](#icon-ball"") **[GOOOOL!!! COUTINHO!!](https://streamable.com/kknn7)** Dembele into the area, picks out Coutinho who has some space and pulls one back. Three to go.

60' - [](#icon-sub"") Denis on for Iniesta (2/3).

60' - [](#icon-sub"") Paco on for Dembele (3/3).

62' - [](#icon-yellow"") **yellow** Coke, for a foul on Coutinho.

64' - [](#icon-ball"") **[HATTRICK!!!!!! COUTINHO!!!](https://streamable.com/ggwpo)** Denis sends a free-kick into the area, cleared away, Busquets wins it and picks out Coutinho who scores one more! TWO TO GO!

65' - [](#icon-yellow"") **yellow** Busquets, for a foul on Morales.

68' - Barca is pressing hard, pushing Levante deep into their own area.

69' - [](#icon-sub"") Lerma on for Roger (1/3).

69' - **PENALTY!!!** Corner into the area and Busquets is brought down from behind by Campana.

70' - [](#icon-yellow"") **yellow** Campana, for the foul.

71' - [](#icon-ball"") **[GOOOOL!!! SUAREZ!!!](https://streamable.com/ev7kz)** Suarez hammers the ball right down the middle and Barca only needs 1 more to bring the game level!

73' - Suarez with a huge miss! Denis sends a free-kick into the area right to Suarez who sends his header too high.

75' - Levante with a chance again, but the ball into the middle is easily intercepted by Ter Stegen.

76' - Another chance for Barca as Denis has his shot deflected, but instead of a corner a Suarez offside was called for whatever reason.

77' - [](#icon-sub"") Pazzini on for Boateng (2/3).

79' - Mina does well to give Morales no space and clears for a corner.

81' - Morales with a huge run as he gets through four defenders, but the finishing is weak.

82' - Nealry the equaliser as Alba's cross is nearly put into the net by a Levante player.

82' - Busquets wants a second penalty for a handball, but it was nothing.

85' - [](#icon-sub"") Rochina on for Morales (3/3).

87' - Suarez down in the area and gets into Lemars face who pushes back, yellow for both.

88' - [](#icon-yellow"") **yellow** Lemar.

88' - [](#icon-yellow"") **yellow** Suarez.

89' - [](#icon-yellow"") **yellow** Denis, for complaining.

90' - Busquets nearly gifts Rochina the winning goal, but luckily he sends it wide.

90+2' - Ter Stegen with a long ball to Pique, lays it off to Suarez who goes for the dribble instead of shooting.

90+3' - [](#icon-yellow"") **yellow** Pazzini, arguing.

90+3' - Oier jumps into Pique and Mina, once more gets protected.

90+4' - [](#icon-yellow"") **yellow** Pique, for arguing.

90+4' - [](#icon-yellow"") **yellow** Mina, for a foul.

The thing is, I am fairly confident there are lots of people out there who can shoot weddings better than I would. And I don't want to ruin their prices. So I thought: maybe stock photography. As my current location doesn't offer many newspaper opportunities or similar things.

But how exactly do I get in there? I went on getty's site and they seem to make it rather easy: prepare a portfolio on flickr, send it and see if they like it. However I am fairly certain they have extremely high expectations.

Has anyone here any experience with getting money off photography apart from the standard: ""UH, I can totally shoot people at a wedding. How hard can it be"" -approach?

Also, I have come across an offering looking for a young photographer to shoot random people in my city. They are not paying for that, because it's a small magazine. They are going to organize some sort of gallery where the pictures would then be shown. Excellent opportunity for getting to know people, they say.

Aside from that, I've read *Lord of the Rings* twice as well, which I gather is not too unusual. I did so mainly because it had been many years since I'd read it, then I saw the films and wanted to compare. 

Finally, I've also read David Gemmell's *Troy* series twice... just because it's so damn good. "

6775,"When my Steelers lost SB XXX, we really thought that losing our perfect record was going to be what hurt the worst.

17 years on, the sting isn't that our record was blemished. It comes down to one (or two) single plays.

For us, we rallied back like you guys did. Neil O'Donnell had a timing pattern to our 6th WR. He ran the wrong pattern.

We stupidly called the same play again with our final chance.

He ran the wrong pattern **again**. 

The thing that stings is that we had the game in-hand. The momentum was ours. But we made critical coaching mistakes. You don't throw a timing route to a guy who doesn't practice with the QB. How can there be timing or chemistry?

That was a hard loss to swallow because it was there.

Tonight you have Crabtree and Jimmy Smith. The #1 WR vs the 5th DB for the Ravens. One you should win. But there was no holding call. 

Here's the rub: those refs weren't calling anything. You have to adjust what you do. 

9 years later, Cowher finally got his shot again and won that 5th SB. In the meantime, we got used to ""you know making it and being that close still counts for something"" and you learn from it.

This makes Jim a better coach. Would you trade 1 loss for a couple wins? This team is good. He won't make this mistake again. The 49ers are young and have a bright future ahead of them. This is all part of the learning experience. 

It's going to suck ass to think about the non-call, but I want to help you get over it: they were not going to all of a sudden start calling that holding or PI when they established that was ok the entire game. It was a mistake. Maybe it was Colin, maybe it was Jim - I don't know. I'm sure Jim will take the blame. But it's one you'll learn from and it will lead to future success. 

I'm confident this loss is going to lead to more wins in the future. It's going to make guys hungry and appreciate it. It's one people are going to question and no one will make that mistake again. 

After we lost, we went on to appear in 3 more SBs and won 2 of them. Anyway, you guys have a hell of a team and like the Pats, you're going to be knocking on the door every year."

Lee Smith](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17563213-cottonwood) is very much like this. but I've yet to read it.

The best example I can give in terms of what kind of cultural interaction I am looking for is actually from The KingKiller Chronicle, when [Kvothe goes to Ademre and learns Adem handspeak and the Lethani](/spoiler).

I am looking for ones about people helping a primitive civilisation get more advanced.

I really enjoy the pacing and the adult language.  It makes it more real to me that someone is dropping F-bombs while getting shot at instead of the PG-13 stuff that dominates a lot of fantasy and sci-fi. 

So what should I choose next?  I wasn't really a fan of Dune or sci-fi like Dune.  I want a good ole Space Opera instead of a thinly veiled critique of environmental and foreign policy.  I'd like to read something similar to the Expanse or games like Mass Effect.

6860,"I was in a discussion here: https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/4dkzzp/questions_about_the_fall_of_hyperion_spoilers/

About the Hyperion / Fall of Hyperion duology and notably explained why the sequels didn't disappoint me that much: I am used to sequels to be inferior in quality to the original books.

A few examples:

- The Foundation Trilogy is epic in scope, over multiple generations, but Foundation Edge and Foundation and Earth, while still being interesting, are not as Epic.
- Dune managed to remain somewhat epic over 4 books (Dune, Dune Messiah, Children of Dune and God Emperor of Dune), but Heretics and Chapterhouse are in a different league...
- Ender's Game and Xenocide are rather epic, but the 2 sequels? Not so much..

It's a pattern I have noticed for almost all Epic series I read from start to finish.

I did read a few that are 2 or 3 books long, like epic trilogies, but perhaps it's too hard to remain truly epic over 4 to 7 books!

I don't know why I started to lose weight I guess I was just fed up with not being able to do a push up or keep up with my friend (who is a personal trainer). I decided I was going to the internet to research everything. Signed up and got MFP and set my goal weight 250 lbs. I did c25k and finished it. Lost about 50 lbs by the time I finished and ran my first 5k at about 275 lbs. This wasn't enough for me. I guess I got hooked. Went to the gym where my friend trains and got on this awesome machine called ""InBody 230"". It gives you a printout about everything that is going on in you're body. I got my basal metabolic rate from the printout (1774 kcal) and punched that into MFP. If anyone wants to know the stats of the InBody I will post them. I basically run and do dumbbell exercises at the gym.  For my diet I stick to mostly white meats. Turkey, fish, pork, and of course TONS of chicken. I tried to eat red meat only once a month because my family has tons of heart trouble history and I heard somewhere that cutting out red meat helps reduce the risk of heart trouble. I also eat tons of veggies and salads with no dressing or croutons.  I am blessed to not really care about the taste of my food just the fuel aspect of it. (weird right?) I cook about 98% of my meals. I found it's easier just to cook all your lunches, dinners, and snacks on one day. For me it's every Sunday. I cook my meals for the week every Sunday evening and put them all in plastic bins. I do cook all my breakfasts fresh. I don't do cheat days or anything. Anything else just ask. I'll be happy to answer each and everybody that asks any questions. And be MFP pals with me. I will pm anybody that info since it is my real name I don't just want to put it out there.
Edit: New goal weight of 175 lbs. I will get there. It will take some time though and I know that"

I mentioned that it’s church policy to have 2 teachers plus a door with a window in each classroom, to protect both the children and the teachers. He stated that there just aren’t enough members willing to accept callings to have 2 teachers per class. This is a fairly large ward in a small TBM town in the moridor. Like 98% LDS.  Maybe a small sign of growing apathy, or maybe even apostasy?

6904,"This could get interesting.  We just got handed a new rule today at work that ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING we do has to be documented in the time tracking software.  It was much wordier than this, but it was very explicitly laid out that every.  Single. Thing. Must. Be. Documented. Down to copying the text of emails, content of phone calls, etc. They basically said that we couldn't be trusted to do our jobs without giving them the most minute detail of our daily work existence.  So,  I sat down at my desk, logged in, then entered in the system that I logged in at 8:00 AM.  Then I entered that I logged my login time.  Then I entered that I logged my time log entry.  I spent all day entering into the tracking site ""Entered time log for entering time log""  My whole team has done nothing today but log time entries for logging time entries. Can't wait to see how this turns out tomorrow.

\*\*\*Update:

So on our morning call, our department head (boss) said that we were going to be joined by our president today (Internal ""mwahahahahahahaha"").  He got on, and here is a transcript of what he said (Yes, we use all sorts of colorful language on our calls): ""OK guys, we get the point.  We fucked up.  We thought a little more detail would be helpful in your time tracking entries, but Jesus fucking Christ, you all took it up a notch.  We should have worded that better, and we probably shouldn't have sounded like assholes when we sent that directive.  Let's just pretend yesterday never happened, we'll roll that back, and please just make sure your time entries have enough detail so we know the gist of what you were working on.""

After he left the call, boss says ""You glorious fuckers.  I told them this was a shit idea, and that they should expect something like this from you sarcastic shits.""

Moral of the story:  Never put smartass developers in a loop they can't escape.  We'll keep going as long as we have to."

6918,"Mistweavers are supposedly pretty rare, thou I do seem to see them in pugs often.    However, the thread on midweek mending tends to be pretty short.. Which is disappointing, as I am always looking to up my game from active sources.  (I also check the MW blogs)  

I realize that it is due to us lacking any raid utility, and that our healing throughput is considered to be pretty low, if not the lowest (thou I seem to do decently well in raids, rarely last in healing).   

I have really come to love this class, and I hope that Blizz makes some improvements on us in the near future.

My question is, what would you love to see added/changed in the spec to make them more viable?

Make effuse worth the mana to cast?
Improve Cocoon?

What kind of cooldowns could be added or improved?"

* Blindsight and Echopraxia by Watts
* Hyperion Cantos by Dan Simmons
* Culture Series by Banks

After I walked away from the second date, I thought of the two girls, and I thought ""I can do  better than girl #1"". That's when it hit me - **I was disqualifying girls**. I became the guy who I wanted to be - who can choose from a myriad of girls, and can *truly* ""Next!"" them. This, in combination with result independence... I feel like a fucking god.

In case you wonder, it took me around 2 years to get to this location, and I still don't consider myself an awesome/epic/whatever ""PUA"". I'm just a guy who approaches girls he likes. I get rejected a lot, still do (it will never stop, trust me), I get lots of flake numbers, but I also have so much more fun than I did two years ago.

6928,"The self-improvement Reddit community is vibrant, brilliant, insightful, and I want to wrap this all up.

As many of you all know, I have been deeply immersed in self improvement topics for the past year or so. Through my blog, I have tried to reach as many people as possible, but alas my writing style and lack of experience often do not provide as much assistance as I would hope.

Therefore, I want to work WITH the Reddit self improvement community in order to develop a valuable quarterly magazine that is filled with submissions from you all. It would be a group project for the Reddit self improvement community and anyone who wants to help is welcome.

The next step for this to become a reality are as follows:

1.	Garner enough interest among the Reddit community to choose a name for the publication, create a website, and prepare to accept submissions (finalize what this magazine will be)
2.	Open up submissions for self improvement topics, such as willpower, meditation, diet, and a variety of others
3.	Create the first issue with Reddit contributors (designers and content providers)
4.	Start a Kickstarter project to raise money for the first printing
5.	Print and promote

So everyone knows, I have no stake in this with no advertisers lined up or any way for me to personally benefit. I’m going to make this as democratic as possible, though I will play a significant role in editing as I will spend a considerable amount of time writing and reading submissions in order to organize them. 

If you guys are interested in this, please either message me or post here and we can create either a subreddit for ourselves or a skype group to hash out the specifics. Thanks!

TL;DR: Collectively, you and I are creating a Reddit self improvement magazine composed of submissions from the community that will initially be funded by Kickstarter. (No monetary gain for myself)

The performance they've already shown is faster than a 1080 and that was very likely an underclocked chip. Is it really so unbelievable that with driver optimizations and a higher clock it will outperform a 1080ti/Titan Xp?

AMD did it with Ryzen so they proved they could do an amazing comeback why is it so hard to believe that they could do it again. I don't know but from what I've personally seen it looks better than many are expecting. Just some thoughts. "

6956,"Hello, this is my first time coming here and I come for advice. Within the past year, I started having scalp issues. Late last summer, my head would itch endlessly and when I'd scratch, it felt like scabs and white stuff would fall. At one point I decided to see if it smelled like anything and it smelled like grated Parmesan cheese, so I guess it was some sort of fungus issue (my big toes sometimes produce stuff that smells the same, tmi!). A friend recommended a shampoo that her mom buys for her and I gave it a try and it helped a lot, but not entirely. It's Neutrogena TSAL/TGEL (the TGEL wreaks). 

Basically, I would like to find a shampoo/conditioner that would help with that as well as not leave my hair extremely frizzy or dry. I have straight, blonde hair that's not very thick. I also have sensitive skin, Head and Shoulders made my back break out really badly a couple years which is why I stopped using that. 

Thanks to anyone who has advice. I'm not too worried about prices, just nothing overly expensive. "

6968,"God, just woke up from a dream where i relapsed. Thank god i'm glad i was on the safe side when i woke up :). This made think about this and share my ideas on this to you. Hardcore internet porn doesn't even sound interesting to me now. Think about it guys, it's the worst thing you can desire... Sure, when your brain begs for stimulation it might want it, but deep inside you, you don't want it. It's pretty sad because we relapsed many times over the same mistake thinking that porn was the answer and trying to find reasons why you should relapse. And of coure WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AFTER WE RELAPSE. We become depressed in deep self-pity that stays there for a week (thats with me). What i really want right now is real love from a girl not harcore internet porn. I've noticed that since i stopped using this demon, i've been more calm and relaxed than ever. But when i was using it i was always worried, anxious, angry, etc.. It was truly hell. Thats why i recommend to you guys to write down the goals that you're going to achieve through this reboot. Basically why are you rebooting? Is it to give up the hardcore porn that demonized you? Or is it for example to get rid of ED? Of course ED is a problem for me too so that's one of my goals. Doing this puts things in perspective so you have a REASON to leave porn and you're not just doing it for the hell of it, you know? Make sure that when you get an urge to watch porn you take a few minutes and think if it's a good idea. Think about the consequences.. Is it really worth it? For just 5 quick minutes of brain stimulation is it worth it to feel shitty, regret, deep sorrow, and above all have to REdo ALL the work that you've wasted? And the funny thing is that it happens over and over where we relapse thinking that it's not gonna harm us at all, but then we all know what happens. No it's not worth it and that's why you need to give up porn FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE because it does MUCH harm. Remember you're only human so it's ok if you've recently relapsed over and over and not learned from it. But from now on, it's up to you if you're going to relapse or if you're gonna keep going to achieve your true desired goals. I wish you all luck. You're very powerful remember that ;)"

6976,"I'm a little confused about the hierarchy. Not that it needs to be clear or shouldn't be mysterious.

But in the second game its implied that all or most of the ethereals are here and he's nowhere to be seen and the only distinct ethereals are the Angelus and a generic talking one at the end. Also they seem to have somewhat different motives. The uberethereal seems to want to uplift humanity but the angelus wants to simply harvest their genes and abandon earth. 

Who do you think is really in charge? Does the uberethereal even exist in the alternate xcom2 time line. Or maybe even the alien brain? "

7022,"let's get this out of the way early.  Here's where I started:

http://i.imgur.com/Alf6xhE.jpg 

http://i.imgur.com/wgxmMrg.jpg 

http://i.imgur.com/zcJOw6W.jpg

I had gone as high as 355 lbs.  It is uncanny the way that sneaks up on you.  You struggle with bouts of depression, with failure, with loss and somewhere along the way you just stop caring.  It becomes easier to fall into routine than it does to work and strive and change.  I honestly don't know what rock bottom was for me.  I see that a lot around here, people seeing their weight on the scale, getting rejected by someone, it is their trigger, and they know it intimately.  I don't have one of those visceral memories.  I didn't get on the scale until after I'd started keto and gotten back into a serious workout regiment.  I have a friend who is active on this sub-reddit, and I'd seen his results.  His positivity really encouraged me, and the results came fast for me.  I've always been a good cook, and this opened a lot of new options for me to explore new recipes and new ways of preparing food.  So much of it seemed counter-intuitive at first, which I found incredibly intriguing, and learning the science behind why the results are happening was almost as much fun as the actual results themselves.

Now, I'm 15 pounds off my initial goal weight, and I'm thinking of actually stretching that down to 220.  I think it's doable, I think it's actually easily doable.  

Measurements:
Started and current

Waist (around belly button): 52"" -> 44 1/2"" (down to a 38 waist for pants)

Calf: 19"" -> 17 1/4""

Thigh: 26"" -> 25 1/2""

Bicep: 17 1/4"" -> 16""

Chest: 54"" -> 48""

Neck: 19"" -> 17 1/2""

Forearms: 13 3/4"" -> 13""

http://i.imgur.com/iYKcMwf.jpg 

http://i.imgur.com/XOKqgnc.jpg 

http://i.imgur.com/yCiNJCP.jpg

If I can give you any advice, fellow ketoers, it's this: Don't wait for rock bottom, don't wait for a sign, just do it.  Start right now.  Middle of the day.  Just change your life.  Taking the risk is an amazing thing to do, and it can be incredibly rewarding.  Right now, I'm broken and defeated, but I won't be forever.  Massive, sweeping lifestyle changes are far more easy than we trick ourselves into believing.  Like the man says in the song: ""When there's nothing left to burn, you have to set yourself on fire.""

I'm going to leave you with the quote that made me reevaluate my life, and hope it does the same for someone else.

""a stupid jock is stupid, and fat ugly nerd is also stupid. A good looking nerd? That motherfucker knows what time it is."" - Uncoolio"

I'm not sure if this is the right sub reddit for this, but I've heard people talk about how great double glazing in homes is, but how important is it really? Surely the R value of a double glazed window isn't that much greater than a single glazed window. And also, under floor insulation is the main factor for minimising heat loss. Does carpet really help keep a house warm compared to floorboards, or is it more psychological? And on top of this, do curtains also help in any way to prevent heat transfer? 

Was just wondering, because to me a thin piece of carpet or curtain doesn't seem to be a great insulator"

7041,"Playing as Militarist/Spiritualist/Authoritarian, I colonized a world with pre-sentients on it think I would be able to eat them for early game growth, but the only thing I can actually do to them is set my Pre-Sentients policy to Exterminate instead of Tolerate. How are they no different than any animal we eat as humans?

Edit: Turns out I can't even eat them (via Processing) if I set the policy to Exterminate, there is apparently no way you can eat pre-sentients (or any species for that matter) unless you are Xenophobic."

7045,"Do you consider the book to be human uplift, or human downlift?

Personally, I have always considered the story to be a downlift story, but I realized today in a fridge moment that it could be seen as either uplift or downlift, depending on how you define the terms.

Technology was stripped away, to a preindustrial level, but science, math, and technologies that could be maintained without metal or computing were mostly preserved.

At the same time, human society was nudged and bumped fairly aggressively into a model where primate aggression would be genetically suppressed, partly by an outside force controlling violence laws, and partly by humans themselves as they began to embrace the new societal norms in something like a global Stockholm Syndrome.

For those of you who have read it, what's your take on it?  Uplift, or Downlift?"

7051,"Just wondering how many other people have really loved a series but been unable to complete it due to a terrible book in the series. For me it was the Dune series.


Earlier this year I started Dune and loved it I continued reading and God Emperor was definitely my favorite in the series. I had high hopes moving to Heretics of Dune but I was deeply let down by it. I still decided I wanted to finish the series, but when I got halfway through Chapterhouse I realized it wasn't worth my time even if I really wanted to know how the series ended.


Anyone else had a similar experience with another series?"

7054,I've been in a bit of a bad way for a while now.  Usually I smoked before I workout to keep the bad thoughts at bay but I injured my knee so I've been stuck resting it. Anyways so now I smoke to try and alleviate the depression while trying to sleep but sometimes it makes me suicidal and even more depressed. I try to combat it by listening to good music but I haven't found anything that's truly kept my attention. Any ideas?

7057,"So I find a nice roaches race on a tomb world. Having previously seen some good tomb worlds, I decide to uplift them and give a big push to space roaches race. But when I uplift them, they become molluscoid.... Well.... mkay.

Then I go and uplift a planet of talking horses. Wouldn't it be nice to have talking ponies? For sure it would. I uplift them, and they become... humans! REALLY? NO, REALLY?

If that gene modification effect is so fucking radical, then why can't I just create a species from zero?

I'd be using it primarily to help with help with weights, but I haven't found any info on whether it would have any positive effects in that area. Also, is it ok to start taking it in general? Doing some research on it I found that it can help make you more alert and uplift your mood, which sounds good of course, but I'm unsure if it makes sense to do this if I don't have any problems currently. The only thing it would seem to help me with is fatigue/alertness, and due to sleeping issues I get pretty tired throughout the day, which i usually use caffeine for (in the form of coffee)."

Once this was completed, I wanted a way to show the true source ISP ip for remote users as the only thing I could see was the internal source ip for the vpn concentrator. The next step was to grab logs from the Cisco VPN and get this information which provides the missing information I wanted.

Other than him, Robert Jordan would probably be the second. The Wheel of Time got me into fantasy books and made me want to write. Also, Shakespeare, being another writer I haven't read much of, has been another big influence. I want to get used to using a lot of the big literary devices, such as metaphors and puns, which he uses a lot.

- Pentium G4560

- 2x 4GB 2400 RAM Corsair LPX C14
- RX 470 4GB

Currently have the above setup and thinking of upgrading the CPU as it struggles to have decent fps in CPU heavy load like raiding in WOW Legion.

I'm thinking of the following options:

A. i5 7500 (2nd hand preferably if available)

B. Ryzen 2200G + B350M Mobo

C. i3 8100 + upcoming B360M Mobo

D. Endure and wait it out to save up for higher specs upgrade.

The i5 7500 right now is the cheapest option even if brand new, here in my location.
The Ryzen 2200g APU is also appealing but I kinda want to optimize it with 3000 RAM which will add more cost.

I am a big guy...BMI over 30 and I have really been thinking about running to lose weight... But I am suffer from large moobs..

I really wanted your honest thoughts on what you dedicated fellows see when you see a fat man running ....struggling...

Deep down - do you laugh at the person? Do you snicker? What is it that goes through your heads when you see such a situation?

Dont worry - if you do feel like the guy is a loser or any such thing - just be honest! It would help me - and certainly other big people know how to react (or how to strengthen the mind) before running

Thanks guys for your opinions (and honesty!)

Guys! Thank you! I mean there is absolutely no way I could have expected such a warm response and I hope that this post will help all those people peeking into this sub-reddit for the first time.

Thank you very much runners! You cannot believe how much anxiety exists within my mind (and I am sure in a number of 'big' people's minds - this goes a very long way in reducing that!

I want to tell each and every single one of you who replied to this post (and I appreciate the honesty most of all!) - Thank You! From a fellow human being - this really warms my heart!

Thanks again guys! I will definitely put on my trainers this coming Saturday and belt out a couple of kilometres.

1). Can just use chunks of 2x4 PT sistered to the joist or do I need something beefier?

7108,"Hi all,

I have a canopy which is essentially a continuation of a skylight. The canopy is open on all sides except on where a masonry wall which is the building entrance is blocking wind. The canopy has blown off completely and a replacement by the same manufacturer is being requested; however they will not take responsibility for the connection design of their own canopy system.

I suspect the canopy is designed only as the enclosed sky light and that they are ignoring the uplift effects of the structure being open on three sides. Further, I believe the building wall causes a drastic increase in wind pressures acting on the canopy. I don't think this case is really covered in ASCE-7.

7134,"I airways thought the planet types were a bit too similar to each other. Arctic and tundra and dessert and so on aren't really planet types, they're more like climates that all exist on Earth. 

It makes a lot more sense to split planets up by atmosphere composition and then subsplit by temperature. So you could have, for example, oxygen atmosphere, methane atmosphere and ammonia atmosphere, and then each of these types can be cold, temperate or hot. Temperature differences should have smaller habitability penalties than atmosphere differences which should be pretty much unbridgeable without genetic manipulation or terraforming.

I live in a tenement flat and the rubbish hasn't been collected for at least 2 weeks. There are a number of bulk items that have accumulated at the bottom of the stairwell, as well as bin bags. I think it's mainly due to students moving out. The rubbish is really beginning to fester and the bin area at the back of the building looks like a war zone.

Is it the councils responsibility to collect the rubbish? Who is generally in charge of looking after the communal areas in tenements, as my landlord deals with the flat only.

Cheers!

Edit: Rodents have become an issue too >_<"

I wanted something memorable. Anyone who has read this series can probably attest to how completely cheated I feel as I'm sitting there refusing to accept that all they gave us was a *hug*.

Is it worth throwing away a part of yourself you knew well?

Is it with becoming someone you do not know and do not apprehend?

Is it worth going through all those clothes and sometimes shoes that hold some fond memories of the past?

Is it worth sometimes losing friends and family members?

Is it worth abandoning comfort and going into an unknown level of hardship?

Is it worth being ridiculed at the gym, park or near the diet food section in the supermarket?

Fucking A it's worth it. Every pound, every sweat and every inch of your waistline; all worth it. Because it is worth becoming a better you, It is worth becoming a person you never expected to be, and because it feels damn good when you exceed everyone's expectations especially your own.

7172,"So 3 years ago I finally realized [220lbs](http://i.imgur.com/CXynKvq.jpg) was too much for a 5’10” guy and decided to do something about it by running. I sucked pretty bad but I liked it, even ran a half marathon after 6 months. I read a lot, but mostly about running and how great it is for losing weight. I kept doing more Kms a week and faster; smoking the guys at the track that smirked when they saw the jogging fatty just months before felt pretty good, I must confess.

I thought that if I kept eating at a deficit (you know, calories are the name of the game) and trained hard I would end up with a fit body. So I finally hit what I thought was impossible: [168lbs...](http://i.imgur.com/F8HvF.jpg) But I looked just skinny; devoid of muscle and still had a belly. After all the hard work I felt a little cheated. I put in the work, I backed off cake, where’s my six-pack!? At around this point my running partner got injured and along with a bit of back pain and the rather unexpected results I lost some motivation and started doing less and less Kms. 

I realized I’d bounced back to nearly 200lbs so I start running seriously again, at least to keep the fat off, right? I got a lot faster, but didn’t watch my diet so I stayed at around 190lbs. That’s when I discovered /r/fitness and since I was getting [decent times](http://i.imgur.com/ooXU5LA.png) I asked how I could complement and strength training was suggested. So I started doing StrongLifts, after reading the book.

To shorten the story at least a bit, I got much faster, but instead of seeing my lifting days as an obstacle for my running days, it started to feel the other way around, to the point I dropped running altogether (except 3K a day running to the gym and back). At first I couldn’t understand why cardio seemed to be shunned a bit by the community, but coming from it I can see why so many do not favor it. If you enjoy it, great! Just be aware that if you only run at best you’ll end up looking ordinary.

So I became a lifter. When SL was too much I moved to Madcow and recently I started 5/3/1.
“Unfortunately” I fell completely in love with strength training and did not fret  over my diet beyond getting enough protein (Read: cake and assorted sweets were consumed in considerable amounts), so my appearance is still pretty underwhelming [(Comparison shots, all morning cold shots, as you can infer by the wild hair)](http://imgur.com/a/453O6). It has been 11 months since I started and my stats have changed as follows:

Squat: 95lbs - 320lbs (Smith Machine half squats vs sub-parallel barbell squats.)
Bench: 135lbs - 260lbs
Deadlift: 185lbs - 420lbs
OHP: 45lbs - 160lbs

I plan to stick with 5/3/1 and focusing on strength for 5 more months, to then start caring more about cutting and perhaps switching to PHAT. 

Things I think I did right:

* Find a program and stick to it. Do not do random stuff or the program the gym “trainer” pulled out of his butt.

* Previous point doesn’t mean SS, SL or whatever is your new religion; read articles and watch videos from other trainers. I found great cues and tips for my lifts that helped my particular situations immensely.

* Focus on strength for a while. I know this sounds like circlejerking, but even though the “get a strength base and then move on to hypertrophy” argument makes sense to me, the biggest value of lifting for strength for the first 4 months is having a clear measure of progress while you build a long-lasting habit. Years before I had tried lifting and quit each time because measuring my success by looks is extremely frustrating. I questioned myself more than once and all I had to do was look at my log and compare to where I was 4 weeks earlier.
* If you do SL/SS, add dips and chin/pull-ups to your routine as accessories for happy arms and easier press/bench.
* On deadlifts, only use mixed grip when you can't use overhand, and only use straps when you cannot use mixed. This gave me a pretty decent grip (I can do 300lbs overhand and only use straps for shrugging)
* Be a calculated coward. Don't fear getting under the bar, but if you feel something **hurts** or bothers you in a way you know something isn't right, call it a day and come back for next session. I have had zero injuries so far, except a couple of very, very mild sprains I spotted at once and stopped the training session, allowing me to be perfectly fine for the next one. I know that If I had been stubborn it could have been much worse. On the other hand, I pulled 405 for the first time with a fever and almost fainted, which may or may not have been very wise.
* Following on the previous point, remember this is not a 12 week, a 6-month or even a one-year endeavor, but a lifetime pursuit you're just getting yourself into. A single training session is not important in the greater scheme of things, so if you have to cut it short, failed a set or your boss needs you to put in extra hours and you miss the gym completely, it's not the end of the world, as long as you pay your dues every other day.
* This community is awesome, use it! Post form checks, the guys here helped my squat immensely. I was doing half squats and thinking I was doing it right. Make sure you read around, too.

* **Edit:** One point I missed: The bros will quite likely harass you a bit, maybe they mean well, but you *will* get criticism for ""holding the bar too low on your back"" or ""destroying your knees squatting so low"". Keep an open mind, listen to them but find reputable sources to corroborate whatever advice you get that isn't in line with your program. Some are harsher and may mock you for using only the bar or paltry weights. Forego your ego and be patient. You will show them (and more importantly, yourself) in due time. 

Things I didn’t do or did wrong:

* Cardio is cool, but be clear in how it fits your goals. It probably won’t take you where you think it will.

* Calorie control is key for weight loss, but macros are vital if you want to add muscle.

* If you care for aesthetics (we all do) and aren't particularly gifted in that department, do calf raises (I didn't).

* Don't neglect your core! You'll get a good workout from the main lifts, but I've found it has somewhat been a weak spot at heavier weights.

* Supplement from the start if you aren’t getting enough from your diet, but keep it simple. I started drinking protein shakes, fish oil, vitamins and creatine fairly recently, and it has really boosted my performance.

So in closing, I'd like to say thanks to everyone who posts and helps here, you've been enormously helpful and I appreciate it. 

*TL;DR* Was fat, started running and turned skinnyfat, started lifting and am a happy camper now.

Do any of you ladies wear styles like this successfully?

Note in case this is relevant at all: I'm also sort of in-between sizes at the moment (34F is fine at the tightest band right now, but 32G is still a bit snug all over, hoping in about five more pounds that will be where I settle for a bit).

7179,"Hi everyone, I'm finding it hard to find information about taking 5htp to help BPD and/or experiences of doing so. So wondered if anyone here has?

I just started taking 5htp as I heard it was good for helping mild depression and well I'll try anything if I think it will help. Since starting taking it I wasn't sure if I felt any better, I think I did but I put it down to the fact I'd lost weight due to my appetite being suppressed!

Anyway, today several VERY triggering things happened to me which in the past have caused me to si and a great amount of distress. Today that didn't happen though. I feel so weird like the the reaction i'd normally have is bursting to come out but I'm just sitting here going over and over in my head about the triggers and I'm not reacting to it other than thinking it through and talking myself into being logical.

7184,"So I am probably obsessing about this without good reason but I currently feel like I might have nought the wrong bike and I can't stop thinking about it.

So I got my YT Jeffsy AL Comp 27 a few weeks ago and I've had a lot of fun with it. In comparison to my old bike it is just so much more plush and slack which makes it 10x the fun for riding downhill. Well and now I am hooked. Since I finally understand what a ""slack"" bike feels like I want more of it. Same with the suspension. 

Now my riding is basically what Enduro bikes are made for. Fireroads uphill and pretty steep rooty stuff downhill. There is also a ""fun trail"" with a few jumps which I am trying to learn right now.

When buying the Jeffsy my thoughts where that 150mm travel is a lot anyways and that I don't ride hard enough for 170mm. My concern was also that a Capra might be too heavy but now I realize that weight doesn't make that bit of a difference. Am I overthinking this? "

Stadium Arcadium, Californication, By the Way, I'm With You, Blood Sugar Sex Magik, The Getaway, One Hot Minute, Freaky Styley, Mother's Milk, Uplift Mofo Party Plan, RHCP. 

For me the main difference so far is that many songs on IWY sounded very unique and different from each other whereas The Getaway, I can't immediately recognise or (as of yet) distinguish a lot of songs from each other. I just feel like it isn't as instrumentally diverse as a few other albums."

I've been doing some research and it sounds like a 4 legged adjustable desk is the way to go in terms of stability. I've heard a lot of positive things about the Fully Jarvis and Uplift desks, but only Uplift offers a 4 legged option, so I'm most likely going to go in that direction.

Has anyone had any experience with the [Uplift 941](https://www.upliftdesk.com/4-leg-adjustable-height-standing-desk/)? Anything good or bad?

It seems like I can order this from https://www.upliftdesk.com/

Jeffrey R Holland's talk about motherhood - not one even slight mention of infertility but he mentioned almost every other parenting difficulty. Same with three or four other talks on the subject of families. Not one mention. From all the RS presidents I have known, all the Bishops, all the GAs... no thought given to how difficult it is to want to be a part of the church when you cannot have children. I haven't attended church regularly since college - seven years later I'm just done. LDS people are too dismissive, if not actually cruel, to anyone who doesn't fit perfectly."

* BSSM: Sir psycho sexy
* OHM: Shallow be thy game
* Californication: Californication

* Stadium Arcadium, Jupiter: Wet Sand - Stadium Arcadium, Mars: Death of a Martian

7215,"Just a thought I've been having for a while.. I've been playing this game since I was a kid. It was the first real computer game I played (I think I played like Frogger and a few other dumb games).  It was super challenging at first... I remember for a while I would borrow as much money as I could just to make Mischief, the big wooden roller coaster.

Then I realized the money aspect of the game, and it became much more appealing to me to play the scenarios and actually work my way through the entire game.  I did this a few times on my parent's computer, and when I got my own, the first thing I did was install roller coaster tycoon.

When I was playing the game as a kid, I could find some strategies online or whatever, as I got older at least and the internet was actually a thing. But mostly it was figuring out on my own how to make the most money.  I found strategies that worked the best, like avoiding food courts, and making the perfect length queue lines, and where to place rides in the park.

I've noticed now, after discovering this subreddit, that I seem to play the game differently from many people here.  I play for the scenarios.  I have rct2 and played that as a kid as well, but I never enjoyed it nearly as much.  Even after downloading the original rct scenarios, part of the joy was beating one so you could unlock another.  This aspect was gone in rct2 and made it much less rewarding to finish a scenario.

I never ever messed around with scenery.  I would put down a few things if I could, like some water scenery or mine scenery if i was building a mine coaster. Maybe I'd add some fences and flowers and trees to make it look nice.  But that was it.  I wouldn't make these elaborate structures and stuff like I see on here.

It just seems like a very different play style.  Most people who post here aren't bragging about what their final park value was upon completing a scenario, or how much money they made over x amount of years.  People show off the incredible amount of scenery they've added to make the perfect coaster.

I think it's really cool.  It's just different.  But I don't think I could ever play the game like that.  I reinstalled rct2 recently and I can't stand it.  It's too.... easy.  The challenge is still there, but if you want to make a scenario where money isn't an issue, you can do that and suddenly there is no challenge.  Sure you can create other challenges for yourself, as I imagine many of you do.

This is so long and I'm sorry for making you read it all if you didnt like it. But these are just my thoughts that I felt like throwing out there.

Anyone else here still play the business side of things?"

7217,"Recently I’ve been noticing that Semc has been using streamers to promote vainglory with its 5v5 release. However, most of these streamers are hearthstone/non moba game streamers.

I think this is the wrong approach, and most of their viewer base aren’t interested in moba type games. I personally came from league of legends, because I needed a mobile game that had the action, complexity, and strategy of a full fledged moba game while being mobile and fast paced.

To this end, I believe semc should be targeting moba (Dota/lol) streamers. Right now is the most critical time to advertise with 5v5 release. If anyone remembers battlerite’s advertising campaign after its f2p launch—their playerbase grew from 3,000 to 42,000 in a week.

Usually even the most foreign of aliens have a limbed appearance with a head, like the Elcor and Leviathans in Mass effect. 

So, I was wondering what ideas are out there for non-humanoid intelligent life? e.g. concept art or the like. For example, energy beings (that common trope of highly evolved races shedding physical form) and squid/jelly fish (hanar in M.E.) are somewhat common, what other ideas are out there for non-humanoid intelligent life?"

BUT, after looking at pictures of peoples tanks, I've noticed some people have the outputs of their sponge filters above the water level, some have it below, some have it half and half. Does it matter? Is it a preference? Does it affect filtering ability? Does anyone really know? lol

I have tried to contact them but no answer, submit a review from the email link but it returns 404 and the return button on the receipt results in a 404.

7237,"   I am a 20 years old college student that proudly attends Marist College. My left arm is frozen in a 90 degree angle and confined to my side. My right arm is also in a 90 degree angle, but I am able to fold it to reach my face and feed myself. I am unable though to stretch my arms out. When I was younger, bones grew near the ribs locking them into place. As i grew older, it caused to me to get severe scoliosis. This is a progressive disease meaning that the older I get, the worse I will become. People with FOP get these things called flare-ups where our muscles will really swell up and the bone will grow, limiting movement until the body tells it to stop. I am currently having one in my hip and thigh and it extremely painful. My chances of not being able to walk are very slim. There is currently no cure or treatment as of February 15, 2013, but there is hope because a clinical trial will start later this year. There is still a struggle  and it could be years till I am able to receive the treatment.A student at my school is helping me raise awareness by doing various fundraising activities.

At my local Office Max I saw a pneumatic adjustable standing desk called the [Realspace Magellan](https://www.officedepot.com/a/products/119694/Realspace-Magellan-Pneumatic-Stand-Up-Height/).

I'm thinking of putting the two together. Though I'm not sure how exactly I would attach the two or if it's even possible. The Realspace Magellan desk is only $300 ($250 with my discount) and the Ikea top is only about $150. So it's not a risky huge expense.

But now, I'm staring down the pike at what feels like the final stretch in this sprint. I've only got about 80 pounds left to hit my goal. That number seems so ridiculously, pitifully small. Especially after the first hundred plus pounds that I lost - thanks to keto. 

I've had a few stalls along the way, nothing serious. And I blew it once with a ridiculous foray into cheating. Every single trial has been a learning experience about how my body reacts to things. And I've learned more about that in the past year than I have in the previous decades of my life. 

If you're just starting out...you can do this. You can. If *I* can do this, you can, too. It's not ridiculously easy, so don't be fooled But it works for some of us, when nothing - and I mean *nothing* else had ever worked in the past. 

If you've reached your goal weight...then thank you. Your journey has been a constant source of inspiration and motivation for me. I kid you not, I don't think I could have come as far as I have without you guys.

7307,"let's get this out of the way early.  Here's where I started:

http://i.imgur.com/Alf6xhE.jpg 

http://i.imgur.com/wgxmMrg.jpg 

http://i.imgur.com/zcJOw6W.jpg

I had gone as high as 355 lbs.  It is uncanny the way that sneaks up on you.  You struggle with bouts of depression, with failure, with loss and somewhere along the way you just stop caring.  It becomes easier to fall into routine than it does to work and strive and change.  I honestly don't know what rock bottom was for me.  I see that a lot around here, people seeing their weight on the scale, getting rejected by someone, it is their trigger, and they know it intimately.  I don't have one of those visceral memories.  I didn't get on the scale until after I'd started keto and gotten back into a serious workout regiment.  I have a friend who is active on this sub-reddit, and I'd seen his results.  His positivity really encouraged me, and the results came fast for me.  I've always been a good cook, and this opened a lot of new options for me to explore new recipes and new ways of preparing food.  So much of it seemed counter-intuitive at first, which I found incredibly intriguing, and learning the science behind why the results are happening was almost as much fun as the actual results themselves.

Now, I'm 15 pounds off my initial goal weight, and I'm thinking of actually stretching that down to 220.  I think it's doable, I think it's actually easily doable.  

Measurements:
Started and current

Waist (around belly button): 52"" -> 44 1/2"" (down to a 38 waist for pants)

Calf: 19"" -> 17 1/4""

Thigh: 26"" -> 25 1/2""

Bicep: 17 1/4"" -> 16""

Chest: 54"" -> 48""

Neck: 19"" -> 17 1/2""

Forearms: 13 3/4"" -> 13""

http://i.imgur.com/iYKcMwf.jpg 

http://i.imgur.com/XOKqgnc.jpg 

http://i.imgur.com/yCiNJCP.jpg

If I can give you any advice, fellow ketoers, it's this: Don't wait for rock bottom, don't wait for a sign, just do it.  Start right now.  Middle of the day.  Just change your life.  Taking the risk is an amazing thing to do, and it can be incredibly rewarding.  Right now, I'm broken and defeated, but I won't be forever.  Massive, sweeping lifestyle changes are far more easy than we trick ourselves into believing.  Like the man says in the song: ""When there's nothing left to burn, you have to set yourself on fire.""

I'm going to leave you with the quote that made me reevaluate my life, and hope it does the same for someone else.

This morning the scale said 277lbs. I've still got a ways to go, but I'm no longer at risk of diabetes, my bloodwork has never been better, and I'm healthier than I've been in over a decade.

I've been wearing a VS 32C for years, but I know it doesn't fit. The cups are alright but the bands are too big. I measured myself using guides here and these are my first attempt at ABTF!

Since CA has said their focus in SP, and to be fair I've seen multiple improvements on the UI and other features that makes me excited. Good Job CA.

Yet I really want them to come out with some patch or DLC (CA, you can call it the Diplomacy FLC) that helps give the AI more flavor.

I think many of us feel allies are bloody useless and most of the time the diplomacy screen is there to declare war."

Ready Player One was one of my favorite books i've read in last several years, but i'm a sucker for nostalgia. your thoughts? what are some of your favorites?"

7388,"I feel like I've hit a brick wall. A couple months ago my best friend died, and I've felt so empty ever since. My grandfather was recently diagnosed with colon cancer, which has spread to his lungs and is apparently not turning around any time soon. I'm struggling in college trying to follow my dreams and it seems like every time I try to go a step further in those dreams, I get knocked back down. I'm in a long distance relationship with the girl of my dreams and have been for two years, but I'm starting to feel her slip away.

Today was my last chance to apply for a position at my college that would send me further toward my dream, but I was rejected again and now I have to wait another 8 months before getting another opportunity to do it again. I just feel so low I don't have the energy to eat or see friends or smile. I have never been so discouraged or depressed in my entire life.

I am not a good Christian. I sometimes attempt to be a good person but I often fail. But I do believe and I really need Him now. Brothers and sisters in faith, will you please allow me to be selfish tonight and pray that my life might turn around? I don't want fame or fortune or material possessions, I just want to be as happy as I was before Jacob died.

7390,"In the 80's they were pumping out albums like it was nothing. Now we wait four years for an album. Why?
 
My educated guess would probably be that they tour more these days because they weren't as popular back in the 80's so they would have toured less which means more time to make an album. Could someone clear that up for me please?"
7391,"I like 

- The entire dune series

- The nights dawn trilogy

- Hyperion (somewhat)

I like series with fantastical worlds, dyson spheres, mind augmenting, bio-engineered lifeforms/spaceships, etc. The more crazy world building the better. The less annoying  and boring politics, the better. Robots are fine as long as the world is well thought out. Self replicating robots are cool too.

Is there a name for this  genre of sci-fi? I dislike politics, stuff that tries to be too close to reality, stuff that doesn't have too much imagination.

7400,"Bentuangie is a type of kratom fermented in a bag instead of the usual drying process with other types of kratom. The fermentation process is said to give this strain a unique flavor and a enhanced alkaloid percentage. Bentuangie is a rarer strain however, it is starting to become more popular. There are many larger vendors who are starting to carry is but (real) Bentuangie can be slightly more costly than other typical strains.  
Maybe when they throw more white veins it makes it more stimulating, and when they use red it has the opposite effect, thus giving different reactions from the same strain?.?.?. (Maybe)"

Right off the bat I'd have to say I didn't enjoy Deathstalker very much, it started out well, but it got so damn repetitive and cliché that I eventually could barely stand it.

I want a vast epic of a multitude of characters, tech, war, intrigue, stretching over long time, and maybe a dash of metaphysics? the idea of an aristocratic protagonist with a weakness, like in Miles Vorkosigan and Owen Deathstalker, really appealed to me, if that helps."

However, most of the places that I believe are safest tend to be uninhabited. The problem with that is I can't find any good maps or soil data. I'm required to use the following maps. Soil, geologic, topo, landslide, flood, shake, and karst maps. What I've realized is that I'm most likely going to have to stick with North America.   
    
So going off the hazard map, I need to stick to the west. I was thinking of either North Dakota or New Mexico. One thing I'm struggling with understanding is what kind of soil I should be looking for. As in, what soil is best to build a house on, and also wont turn into a sink hole.

Traditionally, header icons incorporate the Reddit alien logo somehow, and they should either say ""Reddit"" or nothing at all (since it's a redirect to the front page).  The icon shouldn't say MFA.  A little about why we're changing it - most big subs update their headers multiple times a year, but more importantly, it's time for our community to make a symbolic move away from worn-out, unfunny CDB inside jokes (which now outnumber actual CDB recommendations about 20:1).   [Here's a starter file for Snoo (the reddit alien) if you want it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/15rttf/announcement_tomorrow_there_will_be_a_contest_to/c7pamcs)

 * The current sub description is, ""Are you a guy who wants to dress better? We can do that.  Are you a lady who wants to help men dress better? We can do that.  Do you just want to look at pictures of well-dressed men? We can do that too.""  It doesn't really reflect the way the community works, and we can definitely do better.  500 characters, max.  Text only - no formatting, links or images.

 * Anyone can enter one or both categories, but if you enter both, please put them in separate posts.  The winners will be decided by a combination of community support (upvotes **and** supportive comments) and moderator discretion.  *Note that the highest-upvoted entries are not automatically the winners.*  The prize is a month of Reddit Gold for the users who submit the winning entries.

Thanks, and happy 2013!

*Note: Sorry for the sad-looking ""please upvote me"" message in the title. I always want to make sure these contest posts reach the MFA subscribers who only see posts on their front page (as opposed to those who visit the sub directly). So please upvote for visibility. Thanks!*"

I have played lots of Flight Simulator in my time and am begining to think that maybe this helps, because the past 2 times I was in a bi-plane with someone else flying, they don't seem to realize that everything has to be done gradually, and delicately. 
Like with the take off. All you have to do is accelerate and the plane will take off by itself but I have all to often seen people get to barely enough speed to leave the ground and then act as though they have full control of the plane. Now I really don't want to sound like I'm saying I'm great a flying and everyone else is shit, but I do wish people would at least practice flying in ARMA a bit before going wasting a plane... :)"

[*""The Infinity Fabric connects each CCX to uncore devices such as memory controllers, PCIe controller, SATA, USB, etc.  It is a 256-bit bi-directional crossbar and runs at the speed of the memory controller (i.e. when using 2133MHz memory, the memory controller clock speed of 1066MHz is the clock speed of the fabric. Using faster memory increases fabric speed)""*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/5zr8lv/i_asked_amd_a_followup_question_about_infinity/)

Each has a very similar looking frame in a variety of colors, with one or two motors and a driveshaft. It's really difficult to tell if one is better or worse than the other.

Smardesk is definitely the cheapest, and I suspect that it's because the desktops appear to not be as high of a quality of materials - not that that would be a problem. Smartdesk and Uplift both supply DIY kits if you have your own tabletop, and all three options offer wire management (although Uplift provides more pictures and appears to be the neatest).

This time around Im def getting the 2700x because the price is right, and the default specs difference is larger this time around between the 2700 and 2700x (and they all come with fans it seems). The gap seems more significant this year...with the 2700x feeling like an 1800x successor in reality, based on leaked specs.

One of the premises is that intelligent life cannot be created without an external agency (a patron race) 'uplifting' them with genetic manipulation and a bit of eugenics. Once uplifted the race becomes part of it's patron's clan for 1000 years, and then can uplift itself. Prestige is gained by having more dependent races. I was wondering, basically, how this could be mirrored in the game because it was one of the coolest concepts for uplifting I've read about and I'd really like to be able to mirror that kind of galactic society."

7509,"This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons...

We are a married couple, going on seven years now, and have a great little boy together. Lovely little family and things are usually pretty good.

But there is one thing about my wife that drives me batty. She has the tendency to criticize (nitpick? henpeck? Etc?) me at everything. The way I do things, the things I'm interested in, the ideas I have for what to do during the day, and so on. She seems to be more annoyed than energized by me, and I find myself often on eggshells knowing that I'll annoy her at every turn.

Mind you, she knows this is just her, and she's trying to make herself better. But sometimes she doesn't do a great job of it. She just seems irritated or annoyed with me, or thinks I'm boring, and so on. And there are times where I really am fed up with that.

Apart from dating, this is the only real serious relationship I've been in. She tells me this is totally normal, to be annoyed with one's significant other.

But you know what? I have this nagging idea that couples are supposed to be energized and inspired by one another, simply because they get along, because they love each other, because they are committed to each other.

So, really, my burning question is this - are these sort of ups and downs really seriously that normal in a healthy relationship? I wish I knew, but I don't, and I don't want to have another relationship just to *know*."

I recently became very interested in crypto in general, and Iota in particular. I have been reading a lot, and stumbled upon a crypto research report that happened to be rather optimistic on Iota as a technology - which is good I guess.

One of the main caveats they had though - and maybe it is a question that has already been answered multiple times, apologies if it is the case - is that it is not clear how the development of the technology and of the IoT in general can benefit IOTA coin holders (so speculators like potentially a lot of people here). For instance Ether is used to pay for computations on Ethereum. Where does the coin fit in for Iota?

7555,"It's easy to make an alien race that's basically just humanity with a different skin tone and culture.

What's much harder is creating a species that is totally different from any life-form that we know of, that expresses consciousness in a fundamentally unique and strange (to us) way.

Naturally, they'd find us quite strange as well, assuming they had any way of expressing that that we could understand.

That's what I'm looking for right now. I think that kind of alien really opens up some juicy themes relating to consciousness and human nature. Any recommendations are welcome."

Personally im starting to map out a world in a fantasy setting where mechanical inventions and advanced sciences dont really have a big role at all, its just meant to be a world supporting a story im writing (so no boardgame or w/e). Do i really need to look into tectonics and their effects or am i fine with just knowing that rivers dont flow upwards and that mountain ranges have a dry and rainy side?

The last four books I've read recently were:

* Ken Macleod - Intrusion

* Peter f. Hamilton - Great North Road.
 
* Alastair Reynolds - On the Steel Breeze.

* Neal Asher - Jupiter War.

I enjoyed them all greatly, but found myself in the mood for less ""Hard science"" sci-fi and a little more action orientated stuff with more satisfying endings - I very much consider Neal Asher's work to scratch that particular itch (the Owner Trilogy was huge fun!), but have read everything he has written at this point.

I'd put John Scalzi, Richard Morgan and Jeff Somers (when they do sci-fi) in this very loose category too. 

I was hoping you might guys be able to provide some recommendations?

So, I am going to get the high of my life time this weekend. My friend made brownies with an Oz of Cheese and split them up into 16 (I think).  I got one so I'm pretty sure that's about a 1 G in a brownie. I have yet to eat an edible so this will be my first time.  
  
I am a super excited, except for the fact that my friend said he ate one and thought he was in heaven and then pretty much had his parents call the doctor. I've smoked a bunch before and I'm fine with dealing with being really high but that sounds like a surreal experience.

As it is, if you colonize a planet with pre-sentient life, they immediately start growing and preferentially filling up any useful tiles.

It doesn't make any sense for their population to be fixed at 3 or 4 and then explode once you colonize the planet. Like with stone-age primitives, you should have the option to confine them to reservations or something.

Since they're nonsentient animals, you should have the option of purging them even if your policies/ethics don't normally allow it.

In Mass Effect i particularity enjoyed the political tension and maneuvering between the human new kids on the block and the other established species. I also thought the purpose of the reapers was, in theory, pretty interesting. The into the unknown focus and 'untamed wild west' kind of feel they're seemingly going for in the new game is also pretty enticing.

For Star Wars, to be honest, a big part of is simply that jedi's are *really cool.* I'm petty excited to see where the new striped down canon of Star Wars goes.


Admittedly, and oddly, since i read quite a bit, scifi universes from novels are a pretty big blind spot for me, but those two are what comes to mind when i think of fictional universes that give a sort of sense of living and breathing that really captivate me.

Stadium Arcadium, Californication, By the Way, I'm With You, Blood Sugar Sex Magik, The Getaway, One Hot Minute, Freaky Styley, Mother's Milk, Uplift Mofo Party Plan, RHCP. 

For me the main difference so far is that many songs on IWY sounded very unique and different from each other whereas The Getaway, I can't immediately recognise or (as of yet) distinguish a lot of songs from each other. I just feel like it isn't as instrumentally diverse as a few other albums."

7660,"Does anyone know of any stories or such that deal extensively with upliftment? If you don't know what upliftment is, basically it's when a more technologically advanced race/species/society helps another progress more rapidly/instantly in a scientific/technical/cultural/societal sense. In a way, it's the big no-no of Star Trek's prime directive. It's a frequent topic in Stargate (spoilers, see: the ancients/ori, the tok'ra, the tollans, the asgard, the aschen, and the tau'ri, all with varying stances/approaches to upliftment).

I'm looking for other stories that deal with it, either print or video. Hardness doesn't mean much to me. ""Space fantasy"" would pique my interest as much as hard sci-fi.

Biological upliftment wouldn't be terrible, but technological/scientific/societal would be prefered."

# Game Preview

7673,"I'm starting a new game with a fanatic xenophobe/militarist, because I love playing as Fanatical Purifiers, because... I dunno, maybe because of something in my childhood. Anyway, the largest world I've found that I can colonize has some filthy pre-sentient mollusks infesting it, and I'd like to clear them out so they can't eat all of my food and generally be awful.

My problem is, the option to change my purge policy to ""Xenos only"" isn't showing up in the policy menu, and I know from other playthroughs that they're gonna start growing once I colonize the planet. Will I get the option to change my purge policy once I colonize? I've searched Google & Reddit and I found a lot about purging primitives, but not pre-sentients. Is it something I'm even allowed to do?"
7674,"Hello lads and lasses! In Eclipse Phase, we are introduced to the term ""uplift"", which refers to the process by which an animal is given intelligence. What would be the fantasy equivalent? Say savage druids were going around putting human consciousness into animal bodies... what word would you use to describe that race of animals?"
7675,I recently finished reading the fall of Hyperion and before that caught up with the expanse series. After reading these books I realize I like the concept of a large area controlled by different factions struggling to maintain rule on all of its outposts is a very appealing concept to me. Is there any more books that touch this concept or is it too niche?
7676,"I'm looking to find some new stuff to read, and thought I'd come here for some suggestions.

Basically my journey into science fiction can be described in two parts, the first of which is Philip K Dick. He is really what started my love for science fiction, and I still consider him my fav author. His ability to infuse his stories with psychological states like paranoia and questioning reality, really made me enjoy his work.

Second was my introduction to cyberpunk through Snowcrash and Neuromancer/Mona Lisa Smile by William Gibson. Before them I really had only been exposed to the more classic concepts of space scifi through Clark and Asimov, and seeing how computers and Internet could be used to tell the stories were really refreshing.

So those are the main ones, but other honorable mentions include: Stranger in a Strange Land, The Forever War, Dune, and Transmetropolitan.

So basically I was wandering if anyone might have any recommendations for things to read based on what I've liked so far. 

Thanks!!!

7678,"If anyone could give me a series name or author, I'd love to find that book again.  It has plagued me for years.


I read it when i was 10 (I'm 30) or so not sure when it was written, it wasn't a new paperback when I read it.  I want to say it was called uplift, but I haven't been able to find anything on that.  I think the cover had a saucer on it with people in the foreground.  
"
7679,"I'm looking for some multiple book scifi series that are worth checking out. That is the one of the things that I love about fantasy, the ability to spend months engaged in a single world like The Wheel of Time, ASOIAF and so on. I've read plenty some single sciif novels (I haven't read a ton of scifi overall) but the world and character building that comes along with a series is something I'd like to get into on the scifi side. I don't mind if a series is unfinished.

I'm open to anything but my preferred sub genres include space exploration (esp. in our solar system like The Expanse), and space opera. I'm open to hard scifi as well, but some of it can be over my head. I also love series with political intrigue, so that's a big plus

I have read The Expanse and Hamilton's Commonwealth novels (Pandora's Star/Judas Unchained) but otherwise I probably haven't read any other suggestions.  

Thanks!"
7680,"Just trying to make you all smile, you’re the best! And you’re ALL killing it with wedding planning, whether you believe it or not 💕"
7681,"For me it's Ritual. Fucking great song. I love the riff, it reminds me of Symphony of Destruction of Megadeath and I just love the kind of heaviness in this one. Also vocals in the chorus are so clean and melodic plus great solos. And the ending of the songs that feels like one a hell of a great final of some story, like Pink Floyd did many times, that guitar solo keeps going, keeps playing.
Damn I love this song so much."

7684,"Give small reasoning if you want as well. I'm curious, as I'm a younger (16) chili peppers fan, i wasn't indulged in the funk rock era of the chilis as much as some older listeners have. I was raised on the melodic By The Way so that will forever be my favorite. My list

4. BSSM

7685,"Basically, this dude was getting his life back together, he had conquered several of his past addictions to drugs and alcohol, and he had decided to be celibate and non-orgasmic because he wanted to rid himself of all his addictions. He had no clue that NoFap was even a thing. 

So we talked about it, because I found it fascinating since I have known about NoFap for quite some time. So I asked him: ""Have you felt any benefits from doing this?"" and what he said was strangely motivating because he said: ""No, I haven't, but I haven't felt any cons either."" 

And that was a whole new way of looking at it for me. I always thought that ""I'll do NoFap so I can talk to girls, have more energy, enjoy life bla bla."" And he just said: There aren't any cons to not fapping. And the more I thought about it, the more I felt motivated to do this. There aren't any cons to not fapping, and that should be enough of a reason to do this. 

But don't be worried, for all you who are looking for the super powers, he actually came in to that as well when he said that he experiences that girls can sense when a man is a pornoholic, that they are scared off by that and are drawn to men with self-control, and he also said that he feels he can push himself more in the gym so. 

But the reason I want to post this is because this man doesn't read this subreddit, he wasn't expecting any of these things to happen, he just experienced them as he did this out of his own free will, and that made me realize that the NoFap super powers aren't just a placebo effect that happens because we anticipate that it will happen. 

My current NoFap streak of 9 days have been super easy, I hear his words in my head ""There are no cons to not fapping"" and that makes me stay the course, because it's not something I want in my life. 

**TLDR: Found a guy who had been doing NoFap for 7 months, without knowing of this subreddit, he was able to describe a few of the benefits that we all expect to happen, and therefor proving to me that the NoFap powers aren't placebo that just happen because we expect them to happen**"

I realized tonight, that when I was young I wanted to be her, but now I'm older and (slightly) wiser, I wanna be just like her. My thoughts and feelings go much deeper than this on the subject, but she helped me figure out who I really was and helped me realize I was really a woman. When ever I have doubts, I think of where I've been, what I've felt, and it helps me know that, I'm me and when I have to deal with transphobic asshats, that, in the end, they don't matter to me. Sailor moon inspires me, and she's my hero because of it."

The scene I remember vividly is where a spaceship full of scientists is orbiting a star observing it when it goes nova. Then, they take the ship out to a distance further away from the star and they observe it going nova *again* since they traveled faster than light. 

I really don't remember the plot at all, other than it had to do with space exploration, it was set in our (Earth's) future, and it was what I would consider 'hard' sf. (Aside from having FTL travel, the rest of it was pretty much science-based IIRC.

I read it about 5 years ago and I think it was published within the last decade or so.

I was wondering if you guys had any cool ideas that were inspired by music.

As far as I remember, I've never based an encounter entirely on a piece of music, though. Have you?

I finally got to be a player this week (yay for my player deciding to risk GMing!), and was inspired to make a noble knightly character based on [this song](http://music.jwmusic.org/track/gallant-hero-callius) (and also possibly the Brad Pitt Chanel parody).

I look forward to your stories!"

Did I let you know. 
I personally think did I let you know is a beautiful song and one of my favourites from IWY. The guitar track is nice and I loved Josh's little solo in it. (Not to mention the trumpets!)

Make you feel better
I've been reading people's thoughts about this song being a filler in SA,but lately I've been listening to it and it's a real catchy song with a really enjoyable melody. Sure, no heavy guitar solos but honestly I appreciated that because the solos on SA sometimes got a little too heavy and tiring after a while

Goodbye Angels:
I'm probably gonna get downvotes for this on this sub since a lot of people love GA. I think it's a ncie song and the outro really is awesome but honestly I think the song itself is a little meh, not a bad song but I sometimes think it's praised just because of that awesome outro.

7713,"In most of my game attempts till now I had issues with random lags that could not easily be detected by a (typical) profiler. For one of my previous projects I wrote a quick-and-dirty ""frame-based profiler"" that keeps track of overhead in all frames to fix this. Now that I need it again I rewrote it into a library so it's more reusable. Also did a bunch of optimization so it doesn't allocate by itself (allocation time distorted results) and to save memory.

Wrote a blog post about it, but it got too long so I split it into 3 smaller posts:

* http://defenestrate.eu/2014/09/05/frame_based_game_profiling.html
* http://defenestrate.eu/2014/09/05/optimizing_memory_usage_of_a_frame_based_profiler.html

My sophomore year of college, I became dependent on, and abused a prescription medicine (legally prescribed but I was buying extra from friends) and my grades suffered drastically.  I went from a 3.5 to a 2.7gpa in about a year. I was planning on dropping out of school and even had the paperwork turned in with the academic support office of my school. I left school for two weeks to do a detox program in my home city.  While there, I was strapped to a bed so I didnt hurt myself in my drug withdrawl seizures. During that period of time, I reevaluated my life priorities, and decided that this wasnt the future I wanted for myself.  I completed detox, left the facility, and returned to school a few weeks later. I was able to complete that semester, even with the missed classes, getting mostly Cs. From that semester on, I have received straight A's and one B+, raising my cumulative average from a 2.7 to a 3.47 as of my senior year.  Is this something I should explain in my personal statement?  I have heard drugs and whatnot shouldnt be mentioned, but this was a legal medicine that I was prescribed and became addicted to as a result (I was indeed buying extra on the street though).  It was the moment when I really reevaluated my life, and overcame that challenge.  I have been clean now for three years.  Let me know what you guys think."

7739,"So about a year ago, I read both Kingkiller books in about a week. I want to say that I loved them but the word 'love' simply isn't powerful enough to accurately portray what I thought of those books. Everything from character development to plot development to pacing, etc... is done really well. I mean **really well**. I've read and enjoyed books since but I never quite managed to recapture that feeling of total awe for someone's craftsmanship. My question therefore is whether anyone has experienced something similar. If so, which author made you feel that way?

As far as recommendations go I should note that I'm mostly into speculative fiction (Abercrombie, Rothfuss, Lynch, and Hobb being my favorites) but only because normal fiction novels tend to suffer from a lack of action. I don't mean that as ""ooooh, swords and dragons and wizards and goblins"". I just noticed that the driving force for the plot and the characters sometimes fails to capture my interest.

Hello fellow fapstrounauts! I’d like to share with you my journey through the 90 days. I would like to start out by telling you who I am (or rather who I’ve been). I’m a 21 year old student from Scandinavia. I don’t exactly recall when my PMO habit started but it must have been somewhere around thirteen or perhaps fourteen. It was around that time that my family got a broadband connection, and I got my own personal computer. I’ve always been a sort of introverted kid, and experienced some degree of being picked on as a kid. Resulting from it I would spend much of my time home in front of my computer playing games, watching series and PMO’ing. I remember being scared of going out my door, and I was convinced almost to the degree of paranoia that someone outside were plotting to “get me”. I even remember being paranoid about going to practice, so I would dull my fears with Simpsons and Futurama episodes. (God, escapism is so awful. I must have watched those episodes a thousand times, knowing them by heart. And even taking some sort of geeky kind of pride in it!) Things however weren’t all that bad. I had a small close circle of friends, and I was always known as a smart kid. That changed when I moved to the city to attend university. Until then I’d always gotten by easy by simply and without much need to actually study. Naively aiming for top grades I was naturally disappointed, and my identity as smart was severely challenged. I wasn’t special anymore, I was just a nobody. Depression hit me like a rock, and I grew even more apathetic to life. Several times I tried to change, to start exercising, studying better, being more social, but all my effort were rendered useless by my feelings of hopelessness and defeat. After two years I met a wonderful girl, and we dated for a couple of months, looking at it now it must have been the greatest period of my life. I finally felt that I had someone to live for, this girl was the prettiest girl ever to be attracted to me, and she was really into me. However, due to difficult circumstances we split up, and afterwards I became stuck in a loop of love-nostalgia. It was simply horrible, not wanting any other girl, but still telling myself that I could never go back to her.

Enter Nofap. A friend of mine, a girl studying psychology posted the Ted-talk on her facebook. Out of curiosity I clicked it, and something snapped. Overwhelmed by the results posted on YBOP I decided it was worth a shot. I remember the mood swings, the cravings, the feelings of being physically ill. I decided to start eating healthy to quicken my recovery. I didn’t eat unhealthy to begin with, but I started eating more nuts, fruits, greens and pure meats. It worked wonders, and I still do it today. There were days when I felt manic, would clean my entire flat and then do pushups until I collapsed. Some days I would notice girls looking at me, and I would walk so proud and tall that I radiated positive energy. Perhaps it was placebo, but I realized that if magic beans could make me that sort of person, I could also do it with practice. Nofap made me interested in what else might affect my brain in a negative way. After some research I quit drinking for two months, and started daily meditation, positive writing exercises and recently cognitive therapy. I also made a conscious decision to limit my internet use and I started reading more books.
I went home to my parents for winter break, and some of my new habits broke down. I blame putting too much strain on my willpower, and also having to deal with limited personal space, my brothers’ depression and my dad’s work problems. Add an overly concerned neurotic mother to the mix and you have your personal hell. Nevertheless, I eventually found some sort of balance, and continued to abstain from alcohol and to do meditation and positivity exercises. I remember having a hard time, struggling not to fall back into depression, but a wet dream at day 70 got my hopes up. I’ve never had one before.

Now at day 90, how do I feel? Like it was worth it! Nofap has given me the realization that even a small change in behavior can change your life. I don’t subscribe to the fact that Nofap gives you superpowers, but if it is the first piece in a chain reaction of life enhancing habits the benefits can truly be immense! I know with myself that I will never go back to who I was before this challenge. I now surround myself with great ideas, great books and great habits. I’m propelling myself out of the functional depression I’ve had since I was a kid. My focus has shifted, it is less about preserving myself image, and more about creating lasting change and evolving beyond the need for approval of others. I feel really sure that this is what I want, and I now know that I am capable of attaining such things. I will continue my meditation and my mental exercises. I will continue to expand my mind with great books and lectures. I will continually strive to improve my academic achievement as well as my health, my willpower and my interests. It is so wonderful to finally see my life taking a turn for the better. I’ve only got one semester left, and will probably continue my studies abroad next year. I’ve decided to make the most of my last semester, and will start doing Yoga three times a week. I will also try to spend as much time with my friends as possible. There is also a girl in my circle of friends that has been interested in me, and I will make one final move on her. If things work out it will be great, and if not I’m going to learn how to pick up girls. Thank you all for your support! I will be doing 90 days more!

**How I succeeded.**

* Willpower is a muscle, and if you haven’t been exercising it it’s going to be difficult overcoming your urges by simple force of mind. When you feel the urges coming get yourself in a situation where fapping is impossible. Go outside, call someone or do pushups! If you want to increase willpower I recommend meditation, exercise (both mental and physical) and eating healthy. Also, remove things that you have conditioned to be associated with fapping. That could be both external and internal triggers, i.e your laptop, a thought process or a mood. If you need to, get internet restriction software to block certain pages.

* Surround yourself with great ideas. Read books about motivation, mastery, willpower and determination. It will keep you focused and also strengthen you prefrontal cortex, which is vital in self-control. Read psychology-blogs to learn mechanisms for restraint and to understand the workings of the mind. http://www.spring.org.uk/2011/04/top-10-self-control-strategies.php

* One day at a time. 90 days can overwhelm the best of us. Take it one day at a time. Personally I would aim a few days ahead, and imagine how great I would feel, and how proud I would be at day 7, 10, 14 ect. It also made me proud to know that I was one day closer to my goal, and that I was no longer a slave to my instincts.

* If your mental health is suffering, so will your streak. If you’re like me and have some messed up self-conceptions go to work on yourself. Read up on positive psychology and cognitive therapy. If you can stick with some simple exercises per day, your mental health will improve with time, and you’re less likely to fall into despair and relapse. Learn to value the times you feel down, and see them in a greater perspective and to take them as a part of recovery and improvement.

**TL;DR – Did 90 days. No superpowers. Picked up meditation, reading and cognitive therapy. Watched slow progress to drag myself out of decade long depression. Happy to have regained confidence and to see my life going in the right direction. Will do 90 days more of Nofap!**

She says he looks like a younger version of himself when he was really handsome. He puts his arm out for her to hold onto and takes her to dance the first waltz. Meanwhile, all her siblings are looking at her with envy and she's really caught up in being happy with her dad and worrying about how her siblings feel.

Not a word comes out from her dad's mouth as they're waltzing but it feels so nice and comforting. Suddenly, the song finishes and again, without saying anything, he takes her through the doors to what seems like a never ending, peaceful paradise.

But I guess the shared struggle found on Nofap, the reminder of the tremendous benefits of holding out, are enough to suddenly keep me on course.

7763,"Hi, I have been looking around at some different sci fi books and nothing fits to what I am looking for, and was wondering if anyone would be able to help. I want a book (or series, I don't care) set in space, and set so that you see things on a large scale. It would need to be an action/adventure book and one where things are equally weighted between humans and aliens if that makes sense . Kind of like the fleet battles in Ender's game, but without too much really deep scifi, like where people start talking to trees and then half the book is about some schmo running through a forest trying to find his inner self. I hope I made sense, but if not please let me know because this is my first post here :)"
7764,"Hey I'm pretty new to Glasgow and I need some advice,

I live in a tenement flat and the rubbish hasn't been collected for at least 2 weeks. There are a number of bulk items that have accumulated at the bottom of the stairwell, as well as bin bags. I think it's mainly due to students moving out. The rubbish is really beginning to fester and the bin area at the back of the building looks like a war zone.

Is it the councils responsibility to collect the rubbish? Who is generally in charge of looking after the communal areas in tenements, as my landlord deals with the flat only.

Cheers!

Edit: Rodents have become an issue too >_<"

7793,"Hey Warhammerit! Long time lurker, first time poster. 

Ever since I was introduced to 40k I LOVED it. The fluff grabbed me by the face and pulled me right in. Recently a couple of friends and I have decided to get serious about it and have begun putting together some battleforces to sit down and play with.

I've decided to create my own successor chapter of the Blood Angels called the Obsidian Angels. I dig assault marines and the fluff of Blood Angels so they seemed like a natural place to start. The theme I’m going with for them is heavily inspired by the early Roman Empire. Planning on having some Imperial Guard allies to serve as some Auxiliary troops...but that’s further down the road.

Primary opponents will be Chaos Space Marines, Orks and Imperial Guard.

**HQ**

*Commander Dante* -- 225 pts

**TROOPS**

*Assault Marines* x10 - Meltagun x2, Sgt - Power Weapon, Bolt Pistol, Melta-bombs -- 230 pts

*Assault Marines* x10 - Meltagun x2, Sgt - Power Weapon, Bolt Pistol, Melta-bombs -- 230 pts

*Assault Marines* x10 - Flamer x2, Sgt - Power Weapon, Bolt Pistol, Combat Shield, Melta-bombs -- 225 pts

*Assault Marines* x10 - Flamer x2, Sgt - Power Weapon, Bolt Pistol, Combat Shield, Melta-bombs -- 225 pts

*Sanguinary Guard* x5 - Glaive Encarmine x4, Power Fist x1, Angelus Boltgun x5, Chapter Banner -- 240 pts

*Sanguinary Guard* x5 - Glaive Encarmine x5, Angelus Boltgun x3, Infernus Pistol x2-- 220 pts

**HEAVY SUPPORT**

*Stormraven Gunship* - Twin Linked Lascannon, Twin Linked Multi Melta, Searchlight -- 201 pts

*Stormraven Gunship* - Twin Linked Assault Cannon, Twin Linked Multi Melta, Searchlight -- 201 pts

Total Points = 1997

The goal here is to have a highly mobile force that can still deliver the punches needed to take out heavier units and vehicles. I am a novice player and I know this list will be difficult to learn on but that’s something I’m not too concerned about. I feel this list could be quite lethal as long as I stay mobile and close in for assault. 

What does Warhammerit think?

Edit 2: Changes to list based on feedback. Traded lightning claw for power weapon in fist Assault Squad. Traded power fist from second SG for 2 infernus pistols. Going to pair that SG up with Dante for melty goodness"

7803,"I'm not a physicist or an engineer, just a guy who has been following EMdrive for weeks. I'm wondering if someone out there more knowledgeable could explain to me this nagging ""thermal issue"" that everyone is talking about. My main confusion comes down to this video taken by Shawyer on his Emdrive website: 

http://emdrive.com/dynamictests.html

His rig sits on a rotary bearing that allows 360 degrees of movement and in his videos clearly shows that his Emdrive is spinning by some force. The question everyone seems to be asking, ""Is this a thermal issue or is the Emdrive pushing itself signifying positive thrust?"" 

My confusion is that I find it hard to believe that a test rig as heavy as Shawyer's would move by some kind of heat phenomena alone- I mean, how could heat within the cavity alone actually spin something?

Again, forgive my fundamental ignorance of the physics at play here. I have never to my knowledge observed any kind of ""thermal reaction"" that could move an object like that, and in my mind suggests that this device actually produces thrust.."

7808,"In a lot of sci-fi settings, gas beings are shown as being these intelligent, almost god like beings. A few examples that come to mind are Star Trek, Rick and Morty, and I think even Futurama had one at some point.
But the more I think about it, would life forms like this even exist? Humans developed intelligence because we had to avoid predators and similar dangers. But in theory, I'd imagine most of these gas beings would just survive by drifting around and sucking up moisture/microbes, like a cross between a jellyfish and a whale. And while you could make the argument that they'd need to look for food, I don't see this being useful except on solid planets with complex ecosystems.
Assuming they did somehow become intelligent, what do you think their culture would be like? They don't have hands to paint or build with. Would they even have emotions?
Sorry for so many questions and disorganized prompts, but this really fascinates me. If you guys have any thoughts about these life forms in general, even if they don't relate to the questions, I'd love to hear them.

7812,"Given the changes coming in the next patch, it is less likely that we'll be colonizing small (<10 size) planets within our borders (I'm thinking here specifically of the tech cost). But it would also be a little lame for us to have perfectly agreeable worlds sitting empty within our borders for years and years. So here is a thought: when you have an empty habitable world within your borders, set there to be a small chance some of your pops would appear on that world. Think of these as refugees or outlaws or dissident colonists or whatever. They would eventually grow to fill the planet, in which case you would essentially have a lawless, ungoverned colony within your borders. You could then tie the presence of such a colony to certain events - for instance, it might start serving as a pirate haven. If these events were generally negative, you would have an incentive to eventually (in the long run) colonize all habitable planets within your borders. "

Basically, they're about mankind's discovery and induction into an ancient alien society, made up of many different species and centered around the concept of ""Uplift"". Old, wise species will Uplift young, pre-sentient/barbarous species with potential and guide them in their development, until they are in turn deemed worthy to take on ""client"" species themselves.

Humans are a rare example of ""wolflings"" - a species that has risen on it's own. By the time we make contact with the aliens, we have already Uplifted chimpanzees and dolphins, making them sentient through genetic engineering and placing them in equal positions with us as citizens of Earth. So, by the standards of the aliens, we are already a ""patron""-status species.

My original plan was to start a new fantasy trilogy (new world, new character) but after looking at what many folks have already done, I'm starting to feel I should continue writing in the established series at least for now and let it stabilize.

I did leave plenty of hooks for new stories, and I'd be happy to work on more - so its not a question of would I be happy with it.

I guess my question is this: how do you guys enjoy playing the violin?  How do you find music that you love to play and stay motivated to continue to practice and improve?  I just feel I need a little more than the usual books full of Minuets and Bourees, you know?"
7842,"So I want to make the plunge into a standing desk but I have some severe pain related health problems with my feet/ankles. Long story short is that standing/walking/whatever causes me pain and builds up over time to the point where it can take days to go away. I'm looking for any recommendations for something that is quick and easy to switch from standing mode to sitting mode when I reach that ""oh shit, I should sit down"" point. I'm not too concerned with costs so long as it is quality and lasts a long time. Strong preference to electric controls to adjusting since I would have to do it often.

I was thinking about getting the Jarvis desk from Ergodepot but would love any personal recommendations from anyone else that has any similar issues to my own or if anyone who has feet/ankle problems has any recommendations for any type of mat when using a standing desk."

http://apracticalwedding.com/2012/10/curiodyssey-indie-wedding-san-mateo/ 

We've picked a photographer that we really like, and we like her work, but when we met I felt like I wasn't putting a valid point across about how I didn't like staged photos or 'fake' looking photos, or 'glamour' style photos. I am not asking her to do away with the staged photos (we need some at least), but I also don't want a whole album full of pictures where it's painfully obvious I am conscious of the camera being on me.

Is it rude to send her the link to these photos to try and explain where I'm coming from? I only found this photo gallery after we had agreed to work with her, but it's not a question of hiring a new photographer. This lady is good! I just want my expectations and limitations to be clear.

If it's not overstepping any boundaries, what would be the best way to approach it? 
I have an email drafted but it feels like I'm doing too much explaining/waffling (or sucking up to her so she doesn't feel like I am saying I want her to 'be like' this photographer).

Any advice, ladies and gents?"
7844," I'm am really, really struggling to find any information and/or reviews on L-Shaped standing desks.

 I am in the market for a large (72x30 both wings) adjustable desk. It is hard to really rate these desks when all the reviews are based off smaller 2 leg desks.

 I guess my question really is this... Is an L-shaped desk significantly more sturdy than the traditional 2 leg desk? Based on reviews between the Jarvis and Uplift I was going to purchase the Uplift L-shaped but after checking Fully's website one more time I noticed they added braces to their L frames which makes me question which one is really better, if at all...

 I'm searching reddit, YouTube and googling for any and all information on L-shaped desks and I'm coming up very empty. Any help?

 My concern is with the desk at around 45"" which would be standing height for me. Is it all the same wobble?"
7845,"I am looking for a scifi book that has solid characterisation, with a focus on human and alien interaction - social and cultural differences, language and cognition differences or difficulties, etc. Kind of a anthropological/sociological bent, rather than a warfare one. A lot of scifi with aliens that I've read doesn't really delve into interaction beyond combat.

Books I've liked previously, that are kind of simliar: ""A City of Pearl"", by Karen Traviss. ""A Tang!led Web"", by Joe Haldeman. I liked most of ""The Sparrow"" by Mary Doria Russell, but found the ending too gruesome and depressing and the characters a bit flat.

Other scifi: The previews of ""Locked In"" by John Scalzi, on Tor.com. ""Ancilliary Justice"" by Ann Leckie. ""Feed"" by Mira Grant (not a fan of the last two).

7858,"In Mass Effect 3, Priority: Sur'Kesh, we see that the Salarians have captured several Yahg. They are special in that they are sapient, and as we've seen in Mass Effect 2, Lair of the Shadow Broker, they are sapient and very capable of language. One of their most interesting qualities, however, is their ability to detect subtle body movements and determine if someone is lying. Given Salarian military doctrine, I think it's possible that the Salarians were planning to train Yahg to be their foolproof interrogators.

The Yahg would be trained in Salarian language and interrogation, so that they serve to ask questions to a subject, determine of their answer is a lie, and report the results to Salarian intelligence."

7878,"So, I think I am finally ready to share my weight loss journey with the world. For my whole life, I considered myself overweight. From as far back as I can remember, I was always the fat kid. The funny guy that nobody really took seriously. My diet consisted of a Mcdonald's trip every week and fried foods and sweets every other day. My mother always cooked this way, and I knew no other way. I thought it was the norm. I was also an athlete at the time, but the way I ate counteracted all of my physical exercise I was doing, so there was no body change. I also am a huge Theatre geek and knew that's what I wanted to do in my life. However, I was type casted as the comic relief. I knew I would never be the leading guy in anything unless it was a slapstick. In high school, I developed disordered eating which consisted of binging and purging that would be accompanied by bulimia. I wasn't happy to do it, but it made me feel better. This continued all the way through high school and my first two years of college. By my third year of college, I was 5' 10"" and weighed 240 lbs. I was eating whole pizzas like they were nothing, and throwing up Mcdoubles on a weekly basis. By Christmas of 2011, I was at my heaviest of 245 pounds. But Christmas day was when I had my ""waking up"" moment. 

A man came over to the house that was a family friend and said something to me that I will never forget. He was always a morbidly obese guy as far back as I can remember, and not the smartest tool in the box. But he came over for Christmas and said, ""Hey there, getting a little chunky there. You're starting to look me."" I thought, no fucking way. And that was the moment I decided to change the way I looked. Over the next few months, I took baby steps limiting myself on soda and completely eliminating fast food from my diet. (saved a crapload of money!) By March, I had lost about 10 pounds, and felt pretty good about it, but knew I could do a lot better. I began to browse the weight loss subreddits and came across r/keto and r/loseit. (some redditor told me to go to r/keto. They have bacon!) I would read people's success stories and used them for motivation. Unfortunately that's all I did was have motivation and never did anything with it. But at least I was exposed to this kind of lifestyle and that was important for me. But onto the story, I will come back to reddit later on.

My sister always nagged me about my weight, and it would go in one ear and out the other. I would dismiss it and always made myself believe I had everything under control. So I went to her for help, and she was more than willing to oblige. She told me about BMR and certain formulas that showed how to calculate calorie intake to help with weight loss. I decided to give it a try, and it helped tremendously! But on my 21st birthday, my family took me to Las Vegas, and as I was partying in clubs with my sister, I would see all of these beautiful women and they would just dismiss me. They saw me as an overweight guy and would not give me the time of day. It was a kick in the face to me, and I knew that I had a long ways to go. Throughout the next months and into the summer, I took in 200 calories less than I needed, and it helped me lose about 1 pound a week. By the middle of the summer I broke the 200 pound mark, and I was as happy as I could be. I was going on hikes and feeling great. But I wasn't completely satisfied with how I looked, and I was ready to go to the next step. 

In my fourth year of college, I got into an acting program at a college in Illinois, and knew I had to start taking my career seriously. Keep in mind all this time, I've been talking to my sister about my progress and what I needed to be doing. She kept harking on me about a paleo diet. She talked about it all summer, and I was not really on board with it too much. It sounded too extreme and hard for me. But the school I was at announced a play in which there was the part of Poseidon. I wanted it. More than anything I've ever wanted in my life before. I knew that it would take something extreme to get the body I needed for the show. So I got a hold of my sister and told her I think I am ready to try a paleolithic type of diet. This was in August of 2012. Between her and an ex-MMA fighter at school, I was given a diet plan. I would eat 6 meals a day. An omlette and grapefruit for breakfast, a spoonful of coconut butter for a snack, meat and veggies for lunch accompanied by a handful of almonds, coconut butter for another snack, meat and veggies for dinner, and a spoonful of coconut butter before I went to bed. I also incorporated workouts this time. My workouts before were just lifting weights and running long distances. I abandoned weights completely, and did strictly body weight exercises. Pushups and Situps mostly. I incorporated pullups when I was strong enough to do them. I stopped running long distances and stuck only with sprints. This was where I saw the most weight loss. I went from 205 to 189 in those months (August-November) doing just what I listed. I felt great and looked great. It was where I always dreamed to be. But it wasn't Greek God worthy. Not yet anyways.

The paleo way was great for what it was, and I would recommend it to anybody. But I just needed that little extra push, and the primal way of eating did it for me. My sister referred me to Mark's Daily Apple, which was a terrific site. I started keeping track of my Macronutrients and she set me up with a diet program where if I followed it to a tee, then I would get the best results and be in the best shape of my life. She also taught me how to incorporate deadlifts, bench press, and squats in my workouts. I also carb cycled and ate between the hours of 1PM and 9PM. I did what the urbanprimalist did and dropped my weight to 173. And well... why don't you guys see for yourself what it has done for me.

7881,"I have a PhD in geology and am an Exploration Postdoctoral Fellow at Arizona State University. I've spent most of the last 10 years studying the formation and evolution of the Greater Caucasus Mountains, one of the youngest, active mountain ranges on earth (yes, there are other active and interesting mountain ranges to study besides the Himalaya!). My work is split between the field (making maps of the distribution of rocks and faults, measuring the thickness and types of rocks in detail, etc), the lab (measuring the age of minerals within rocks), and the computer (modeling the development of topography of mountains and doing detailed analyses of natural topography). More generally my research is focused on the links and potential feedbacks between the processes that build mountain ranges (faulting, folding), the processes that destroy mountain ranges (erosion by rivers and glaciers),  the role that climate plays in both, and how the records of all of these interactions are preserved in the deposits of sediments that fill basins next to mountain ranges.

3. Be descriptive when giving feedback. Use timecodes to highlight certain parts.

Please link to the feedback comments you've left in your top-level comment. This will show others the feedback you've left, and you're more likely to get feedback yourself! Also, please notice those who are leaving a lot of feedback and give them some, too. This is a cooperative effort!

7928,"Hi all,

So I've started a framework for guidance to an Accessibility in Tabletop Gaming Wiki, that I would like to make available to the community. The site as it's currently structured approaches Accessibility Needs from a conditional approach primarily. So far the Physical Needs section is populated, but there are many links that still need information. (As a quick heads up, some of the information you'll see on that is geared toward children as gamers, but that will modify over time.)

If you have a disability, work with the disabled, or have guidance and suggestions for gaming, I encourage you to visit and contribute to the community. I believe this will hopefully become a great resource for providing more accessible tables in the future. Our community is often supportive, and it's great to see the efforts people make toward achieving that end.

You can visit the site below. To edit data you will have to create an account.

Something I've always had trouble with is buying decent jeans. My disproportionately wide thighs and skinny shins mean many pairs fit weirdly, and then after a few months they get the dreaded crotch holes from my thighs rubbing together.

I had to take 3 pairs back to Topshop and demanded a refund after the 3rd because they all wore through in a couple of months. The sales assistant's response? ""oh, yeah, they do that."" 

My preferred jeans style is skinny big how do you find jeans that don't go super baggy at the knee after one wear? 

I like GAP premium super skinny jeans (I buy them from gap outlets) although they're definitely guilty of wearing through! The perfect shape for me though. "
7940,"Hey r/JBP. I'm deciding whether or not to join a local youth group and I'd really appreciate any feedback.

I'd love to learn more about Christianity and to take part in a positive community, but I'm a bit uncomfortable with the parts of the sermons that are like, ""god has reached out to you and you have have slapped him in the face with your sin."" lol. the dogmatic, guilt-trippy bits.

I don't believe in the Bible literally, but it seems like the average priest does. When you go to church and you ""talk to God,"" are you supposed to be speaking with an almighty creator? When people talk about how great ""He"" is, are they speaking metaphorically? Let me know how you see it and how others you know see it.

7949,"I have a PhD in geology and am an Exploration Postdoctoral Fellow at Arizona State University. I've spent most of the last 10 years studying the formation and evolution of the Greater Caucasus Mountains, one of the youngest, active mountain ranges on earth (yes, there are other active and interesting mountain ranges to study besides the Himalaya!). My work is split between the field (making maps of the distribution of rocks and faults, measuring the thickness and types of rocks in detail, etc), the lab (measuring the age of minerals within rocks), and the computer (modeling the development of topography of mountains and doing detailed analyses of natural topography). More generally my research is focused on the links and potential feedbacks between the processes that build mountain ranges (faulting, folding), the processes that destroy mountain ranges (erosion by rivers and glaciers),  the role that climate plays in both, and how the records of all of these interactions are preserved in the deposits of sediments that fill basins next to mountain ranges.

See, I like helping people.  I want to do that with my law degree.  However, I got my first legal job last semester and the only way I can describe it was a god-damned lawsuit factory.  Dirty tort lawyer type stuff.  I know not all law is like that, but I'd like a reminder.  So:  r/lawschool:  give me your uplifting stories about practice.

I had surgery 3~ months ago and I'm kinda regretting going so big (I was supertiny beforehand><). My left breast in particular aches because of the lack of support.

7973,"MCU really love the trope of “Female characters have to be straight man or super serious all the time” cause Black Widow, Scarlet Witch, Gamora and Nebula are very serious-type characters.

I understand of why they’re so serious but can we have female characters that is not super serious all the time?

I feel writers take the female characters a bit too serious but who know? Shuri is one of female characters who is not super serious all the time which make sense since she’s youngest out of Black Panther cast.

I hope Captain Marvel is not another type of female character that is super serious all the time. Can we take a break from “every female characters have to be super serious all the time”

You know, tone down the seriousness.

EDIT: If Scarlet Witch was in Doctor Strange 2, Can we toned her character down in term of seriousness cause most of her movies are a “trauma zone” for her and can we have 1 Movie where she wasn’t act like everything is her fault-type situation. It would get repetitive. Just saying."

The story itself is so awful, the aftermath is awful, it's just one horror after another.

I know it's not right but, I'm feeling discouraged by God's Word today. I'm trying to figure out how to make meaning of this story or understand what God is trying to tell me, but in light of some really negative thoughts I've been struggling through lately, I don't know what to think.

There were other people. one lady i was visiting in the trailer. and other people in the trailer park. there were bonfires and pool parties and beach days. it was glorious. and i didn't drink. so i also got to wake up whenever i wanted feeling good. go for bike rides and feel good. leave the party when i wanted and make good choices for myself. I wasn't even tempted to drink because i was enjoying the feeling of being on vacation not hungover. It's amazing to return to regular life rejuvenated and refreshed rather than worn out, dehydrated and sunburned. 

One of the best things about quitting drinking alcohol is all the little surprises sobriety brings. When I was first quitting (and definitely when i was drinking) the thought of a sober vacation sounded like an oxymoron. now it's the highlight of my year. Sober on, my friends. "

8011,"You can't argue with numbers, Decred finally broke through ~40 ranking: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/decred/

Well deserved, folks may finally be seeing through the FOMO fog of all the snake oil salesmen of some higher cap coins, with trading times getting roughest in 4 years in the space."
8012,"Just got a 20' x 96' hoop house with 6' spacing between the arches. I hired someone to set the posts and construct the frame, and specified that the posts need to be set 18"" deep as per the vendor and that the manual needs to be followed to the letter. They set the posts today and I just went out to check: no evidence of concrete at the surface. Checking in with them, they told me they set the posts 18"" deep, but that they poured only 8"" of concrete at the bottom and filled the rest with dirt, as according to them it makes for a better foundation that way, and that bringing concrete to the surface is unnecessary in Arizona. I've never seen a post set the way they did it, and think it may be possible they just wanted to cheap out on concrete. Any opinions?"
8013,"My favorite series of all time was Dune. The original ones by Frank Herbert blow my mind to this day. I've reread the series multiple times over the years, and always learn something new.

Most recently I've been reading through a lot of Alistair Reynolds, and find that it's sort of hit or miss. But when he gets it right like Revelation Space, it is awesome.

But I'd have to say my most recent favorite series was the Three Body Problem trilogy by Cixin Liu. The concepts were amazing, and I found myself thinking about the books for a long time afterwards.

I come to this sub every time I walk into a bookstore to try and add to my collection of scifi, so I really appreciate all your opinions and recommendations. What are your favorite scifi series, and why?

Also, would a monitor arm be better or worse than setting my monitors directly on the desk?"

8020,My sister just purchased a home with a deck that had just been built with No permits. She got 3000 dollars towards closing cost for this. Anyhow she just told me that the seller told her he had only dug 2 feet for the footings. She lives in north jersey. I built a deck not too long ago in nj and my town made me dig 44 inches! Her deck is attached to the home so what are the chances that it will be lifted in the winter from the frost heave? Now that i told her shes very concerned. The deck is something like 16x10.

8030,"We started using tax free childcare recently, and can't seem to figure out exactly how the cap is applied to the account. There is no proper documentation, and the calculation of ""available bonus for this period"" on their webpage seems to be wrong, as it varies depending on the sum currently in the account - i.e. if I make a payment the sum increases!

Officially, we can receive max £500 per child in every 3 month period, but are those periods fixed 3 month chunks from the registration date (i.e. assuming a 12th Feb registration date: 12/02-11/05, 12/05-11/08 etc.) - or rolling 3 months so that in any 3 month period we can't receive more than £500.

On top of that, made a debit card payment that should have attracted a bonus under both systems, and 10 days later it is still not there... 

Has anyone had any luck in figuring this out?"

8032,"I've recently started a Mistweaver Monk, and I've been reading about some of the abilities. I've checked around online and haven't been able to find a definite answer to a question that I'm curious about. If I use Renewing Mist, and let it jump it's full two times, and then use Thunder Focus Tea, followed by Uplift, what exactly happens? I understand that the healing duration of RM will be refreshed, and that's extremely useful on top of Uplift's already decent heal. But when I refresh it, does it only refresh the healing duration, or does it refresh the jumps as well? Essentially what I'm asking is, does it give me ~20 seconds of healing on three targets, or does it give me ~20 seconds o healing on nine targets? I'm sorry if this question has been answered before, but I've never really taken an interest in monks until now. Thank you in advance."

In the final book of the Uplift series, *Heaven's Reach*, one of the characters uses a special ship to explore ""E-Space"", which is a realm where apparently a person's perception affects what's going on.  It's pretty bizarre.

Does anyone have any idea about what's going on with this?  Brin is fairly hard SF; is there some idea or theory he's working upon here?"

What's our best option (USPS, UPS, others?) and how much would it cost? 
We ship around 1000 items a month from Chicago, they're all standard weight and size

In terms of my favourite class, disc priest, I don't really think we need fixing in PVE. I'd love a little more mana regen, but then who wouldn't.

For resto shamans, while buffs are always nice, these don't address our biggest issue - weak healing unless the raid is stacked up. In fact it just buffed our one strength! Apparently the reasoning is that buffing any other spells would make us OP in PVP. No idea there - I'm not a PVPer.

So what would you like to see change in your preferred class?

Basically, they're about mankind's discovery and induction into an ancient alien society, made up of many different species and centered around the concept of ""Uplift"". Old, wise species will Uplift young, pre-sentient/barbarous species with potential and guide them in their development, until they are in turn deemed worthy to take on ""client"" species themselves.

Humans are a rare example of ""wolflings"" - a species that has risen on it's own. By the time we make contact with the aliens, we have already Uplifted chimpanzees and dolphins, making them sentient through genetic engineering and placing them in equal positions with us as citizens of Earth. So, by the standards of the aliens, we are already a ""patron""-status species.

Aliens, interstellar civilization, genetic engineering - lots of cool futurist stuff here! "

My pipe in hand, my cap pulled low.  
Bundled in wool, chosen with care,  
Seated upon my only mare.  

  
Down the endless path I go,  
Winding left and right, to and fro.  
My eyes rise in awe as I finally see,  
The snow tipped mountains, they are calling me.  

  
Down the endless path I go,  
Water trickles down below.  
I raise my eyes to finally behold,  
The landscape of these tales of old.  


Down the endless path I go,  
My strength comes back, beginning to grow.  
I turn around for one last gaze,  
My home is gone, tis but a haze.  
  

Yet still down this endless path I go,  
Pipe still in hand, cap still pulled low.  
Alas, tis adventure I truly crave,  
This road will guide me to my grave.

I started doing a paper route at night where I deliver papers to 5 different apartment complexes so I have to climb stairs and run through 40 or more buildings to drop the papers. The workout is grueling each night. Been doing that for 3 weeks. Have lost 17 lbs so far total. I quit the fad diet and cut out sugar, soda, junk food, etc. I currently give myself one day every two weeks to eat what I want as an incentive. Hoping to get down to 190.

I've got a 10 month old dachshund mix and his ears did some weird things when  we first got him(11 weeks). They were up, floppy, up, mixed, and they finally decided to stand straight up. I love how they sit straight up because they're giant and make him look like dumbo :)

I have a Halloween costume for him and it goes over his head. I had it on him for 10 minutes or so before I took it off. He didn't mind having it on, but I noticed one of his ears was kind of half up and half floppy after I took the costume off.

Now here's the question: Could wearing a costume or a hat that restricts the ears cause their ears to from straight to floppy? I know when they're younger their ears could be affected in such a way, but at 10 months?

I know it's a silly question, but i don't want to damage his ears because of Halloween."

Just finished Existence and cannot decide whether it's a keeper. To me it was two books in one, with the last third having a completely different tone to the first two. It could probably have been at least a hundred pages shorter too, and benefited from less 'made up' words/language.

I can agree with you guys on Brin not being the best writer for this series. But I really loved the whole idea of uplifting and also the idea of ancient races and finding clues about these races. I read the books long ago and at the time I enjoyed them.

I do think that the uplift world would/could make for a good TV series, like GOT."

I'm looking for alternatives to energy drinks (like monster etc..) because those tend to give me really bad stomach aches. I'm looking for some sort of powder that I just add water to and drink. I'm hesitant to try some of the protein powders because I've had protein drinks before and a lot of them make me super bloated.

* FTL travel, Cryogenic stasis just always bores me but I really don't care how it happens, warp drive, wormholes, hyperspace, it doesn't really matter to me

* written in the last 15 years ( preferably 10) I am not trying to hate on classics here but often times I am simply bored with them.

To help narrow down suggestions here are some series I have read and enjoyed immensely. 


* B.V. Larson's Star force, undying mercenaries, and lost colonies series,

* Dietmar Wehr's Synchronicity war

I am looking in the rough range of $1000-1500, but I am not opposed to spending a bit more, so I am curious what all of your opinions are regarding the Jarvis or the next level up in quality/stability/whatever.

I am also looking into peripherals as well, i.e. monitor stands (for 2, possibly 3 monitors), underside PC mount, anti-fatigue mat of some kind, cable management etc.  I've been reading lots of reviews but would love to hear some of your opinions on what you use."

8127,"David Brin's Sundiver was great in that it had all sorts of bizarre aliens wrapped up in diplomacy on a cosmic scale. I loved that component of the story and found the interaction between humanity and aliens very satisfying. What other sf books are out there that deliver in a similar vein? Off the top of my head I think of good examples like The Player of Games, A Fire Upon the Deep, and Embassytown... what are some other ones?

Also, I noticed Sundiver hasn't had its own thread in a while and was wondering what people thought of it?"

8131,"So I've been looking for a copy of the Nightlife 3rd Ed corebook and supplements for a few years, but sadly Im not willing to pay crazy ebay prices. So it still eludes my greedy grasp.

It all started when I picked up the Night Moves supplement at Half Price Books several years ago on a total lark and as soon as I read the pre-mades I loved the complete goofy 90's nostalgia. 

I know I would never play the base system but I desperately just want to own such a wonderfully silly yet sincere game. I mean a game that has an NPC trash golem named ""Love Hindenburg"" who loathes humans before AK-47 made it cool...how can I not have the entire product line in my life?

I'm in the process of studying for the WRE PE right now, about 116 hours down so far.  I managed to get my hands on an old 2008 NCEES practice exam and this seemingly simple question has me stumped:

https://imgur.com/a/6NiUZ

The solution given is dead + wind, but no explanation is given.  Obviously the wind will create uplift, and the dead will resist the uplift as well, but why won't the live have any affect?  Everywhere else I see in the CERM has you consider live loads for design at a factor greater than that of dead loads.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated!

Also, off-topic, but the 2008 NCEES practice exam is WAY tougher than the 2014 NCEES practice exam!

8144,"My father owned guns, his father owned guns, and his father before him owned guns.

I recently sat down and thought about why I am such a devout 2nd Amendment advocate. In order to tell my story, you must know my father's.

My father way born in 1929 in a farming community in Farmersville, Oh. He had one brother and 2 sisters. Life was simple compared to today's standards. He was hardworking and good with his hands. 

Growing up he would tell me stories of his father and grandfather. Rarely did his strories mention anything other than hunting. Trips filled with shooting squirrels at 60 yds. with a .22, or going pheasant hunting and having to kick them to make them fly. Each story was memorizing, and glamorous, no matter how exaggerated. In the mid 70's our farm house was broken into and all of our family heirlooms were stolen. Everything.

At a young age (5) we lost our farm due to some bad dealings on my father's part. We then moved into a less glamorous place for a short while, then to Dayton. While in Dayton we got back on our feet and my Father opened a Flea Market. While there e started buying and selling guns. And this was the beginning...

My father then began to notice my interest in guns. Before he ever put one in my hand, he showed me something. It was an Eddie the Eagle VHS from the NRA. Once I finished that video he sat me down and asked if I had any questions. I didn't know what to ask; I just sat there. He said he wanted to take me somewhere to learn more about guns, and if I passed I could shoot some. Of course I wanted to shoot guns, so I said yes. The next weekend he took me to Ohio's hunter safety program so I could get my very own hunting license. He didn't need to take Ohio's program because of his age, but he sat next to me through that entire program for me. (Today I was teaching someone about firearms and recalled some of the information that I was taught in that class today.) We took the test together, he scored a 93, and I got an 87..he probably cheated. 

Fast forward to that Christmas...a weird shaped package under the tree, about 2 1/2 feet long, heavy in one spot, and soft to the touch. I had no idea what it could be, even though I regarded myself as the Sherlock Holmes of figuring out Christmas gifts. I tore opened the package, my eyes wide with excitement, heart racing...and there it was. A gorgeous Marlin Papoose, wood stock. It looked to have never been touched by a human hand. The best gift imaginable. 

We went hunting that spring on a friend's property. I asked my dad what we were hunting for me and he said, ""Whatever we see."" We didn't see anything that day. Spending time together was better then shooting a rabbit. 

When I was born my father was 54 years old. I was a mistake. I was the only son to a family of 5 daughters (not all from the same marriage). I was born in 83. With my father being older he was not able to play all the sports that the other fathers could in my age bracket. But the one thing he could do with me, and teach me, is how to shoot a firearm. 

I eventually lost my fascination with firearms and sold my beloved Papoose, a 410 Mossberg pump, and a Marlin .22 bolt action. I don't know what I thought was so important, but I don't remember those things. I was around 17. 

When I was 20 my father asked me to take him to the doctor's. He hadn't been able to keep down food. 2 years prior my parents got a divorce, they remained close friends. My father was a big guy, even at 73 (the time of the doctor's appointment). 6'2 245 lbs. Strong as an Ox. I sat in the waiting room, and out comes a nurse, ""Your father would like to see you."" I went in the room and there he is, wrangler slacks (yes, slacks) and cowboy boots, no shirt. He looks at me, a very serious look in his eyes, ""They gave me a woman doctor, she tried to stick her finger in my butt. I said Hell No."" I laughed so hard. 

That was the day he found out he had cancer.

My father had to sell all of his guns to help pay for his cancer treatment. His beloved gun was a Colt Diamondback 2 1/2 with pearl grips. It was his dream gun. It broke his heart selling that. I talk to my wife about it often how I want to buy one, but it is never the right time.

Before he died he went to the gun store and he saw a Ruger lever action .17 HMR with a 10/22 style box magazine. He skipped a treatment so he could buy it, 159.99. He drive to my apartment to show me the gun. I didn't like wood stocks, guns, or lever actions. I was unimpressed. He said he wanted to shoot it soon. 

My father died October 11, 2003. We were never able to shoot it. 

A Ruger model Ninety-Six chambered in .17 HMR started my collection. My father left nothing behind but that firearm. 

When I hear people say that they want to disarm me, take away my protection. They are trying to take away more than that. They are trying to take away my past, my memories, my family's history. 

I own guns, my father owned guns, his father owned guns, and his father before him.

Edit: I fixed a few mistakes

When we looked at purchasing a house we actually saw cracks in the exact same spot in several of the split-levels we looked at.  Our house actually seemed to have an ""engineered crack"", although it was not quite in the right spot.
The crack is on the wall going from the main level to the upper level.
I assume this is because of the way split-levels are built and the settling (this house was built in 1990) and change in weather each year.
Is there a way to brace this from behind to that it better shifts?  We have access to that wall through the master bedroom.
Hopefully someone out there knows exactly what I'm talking about and can give some insight.
We live in Alberta, Canada.

8152,"So one of the main complaints about the prequels, mainly the first two, are that they're too political. Every rant I've heard about how terrible the prequels are includes: ""Who want's to watch a Star Wars movie about trade embargoes and the galactic senate and blockades?"".

While I agree that Star Wars was not made so that we can watch ambassadors argue in the Senate about emergency powers, I think that the Star Wars universe is big enough to where I actually really enjoy that stuff.

I'm not into politics and 9 year old me definitely didn't care whatsoever about chancellors and trade federations, but for some reason I really enjoy the political aspect of the prequel universe. Maybe it's purely because it adds depth to a universe I love.

Also! I think that Palpatine's arc and involvement throughout the prequels as he positions himself to take over is one of the most well-executed parts of the trilogy. And the idea that politics and democracy was a prominent part of the universe and is then somewhat eradicated by the Empire is a cool one to me."

8161,"Background: I'm a closet atheist. Only my wife and closest friends know. I haven't believed in a god in about two years and haven't been to church in one. My cousin who also happens to be one of my closest friends, is getting married in one month.  He is not one of the people that knows. 

I'm not sure how to handle this. My temple recommend expired about 6 months ago, and I feel taking the steps to get it renewed would be personally immoral and dishonest. So attending the actual sealing is out of the question. I also plan on being outside the temple waiting to greet them, and involved in the reception. 

My dilemma comes in explaining how I miss just the sealing. I live about 2 hours from where he's getting married and I do work the morning of the wedding. But I'm afraid if I just say ""oh I was working so I just barely missed the sealing"" or ""oh i forgot to renew my recommend"" he and all my family will think I'm a lazy shitty friend. I'm not ready to come out to my entire family as an atheist. How would you handle this situation?

TL;DR - Trying to avoid going to the temple sealing of close friend/cousin without seeming like a douche bag. "

My budget is rather tight so I would like to keep as much as I can from my existing system for now. However, if it isn't worth the upgrade for an FX X3XX series chip I'd rather sit on the money I'd spend and eventually move to Ryzen. 

Any input on which pathway you would recommend is appreciated. "
8184,"I've noticed recently that both the Panache Envy and Jasmine have bands riding up my back. I have very heavy, dense breasts and was wondering if maybe I just need more support in the cup and it's pulling the band up in the back? I also don't feel like I get the best uplift with either bra, which is what made me think maybe I need more support.

Does this sound like a possibility? Both bras are in a 34JJ and my snug underbust is somewhere around 35.5 and the tight underbust is 33.5 so a 32 will probably be too snug. Of course I could always go with an extender, but if my boobs needing more support is the reason for my band riding up it might not help. "

8186,"I apologize if the title is too vague, but I'll try to clarify here.

When I try to write stories, I typically come up with a small number of words for it (like 50-100, sometimes 500). But it's always out of order. One time I may write about some random event in a character's history, and another time, I'm writing about a completely different character in a completely different part of a story.

I had concerns over whether or not this is an issue because I haven't really made anything in the order of beginning to end, and since it seems to be all over the place.

At the same time, I do realize that I am still writing, which is better than not writing. I'm just new to taking it this seriously and want clarification."

On the other hand when speaking to my fellow freelancer earlier, he doesn't and it's not a practise he has heard or thought of.

8225,"Hello all, 
I am wondering what is your favourite story (short or long, doesn't matter) on the classic theme of alien civilisation contact?
I am thinking in particular at realistic scenarios, where the possibility of finding a message or a sign of alien existence is developed with some scientific rigour.
My favourite so far is Contact by Carl Sagan, but I am thinking there must be something else out there.

What do you like the most of these kind of stories?

8226,"    Alone on Earth at last
    Shunned in this house
    Isolated in a desert
    Far off in the west
    Coldness blow
    Dust storms weep
    The sun radiates on atomic soil
    No green exists on desecrated grounds


    All towns in cinders
    Choked of all spirit and unity that built them
    They crumble into ash for time's own sake
    Of the buildings which shake
    Through howling winds
    A dark tower breeds quiet malevolence


    The tower I call home
    Last of those that breathed remnant thoughts 
    Nothing of value before the war
    Where many stood so great and plain
    They answered the plights of men and dreams


    Now...a symbol shrouded black
    Its doors closed to hollowed men
    Hidden by shades and shadows
    Masked with former greed and invisible fires


    The eagle's dream
    Lies atop this tower
    Facing the sun 
    Old World Flags


    A universal dream
    Long since passed
    Greed was its driving force
    Now torn asunder by its creators
    An abstract notion of freedom
    It was all an illusion
    Always under control
    The people and ideas
    All focused on self-preservation
    Nothing higher than itself worshiped


    The dark tower is the dream
    The nightmare of all enlighten
    Still stands tall
    To oppress the non exist
    I stand alone
    Alas I am alone"

I disabled the XMP Profile 2400Mhz@1.65V and base clock became 1333Mhz@1.5V

I never bothered with Manual Timings so everything was set to auto.
  
After that the Game hasn't crashed in as much as 7 Hours straight, when before it would Crash Randomly after A few Minutes, 1 Hour or 3 Hours.

Crash to Desktop with no Error Message.

I Manually set all the timings/Volt provided by the Internet site.

Game started Crashing Again.

I lowered from 2400 to 2200(next lower step my Mobo allows) and set the same Timings.

No Crashes again.

Memtest86 could not find any Errors and only once it showed a vulnerability to ""high frequency row hammer bit flips""

How come that only Games show the ""instability"" of my RAM, but the rest of the System is unaffected?

I found it out while playing the game FFXV WE"
8272,"I understand the basic part (bitcoin for the masses), but their website doesn't say much about how it works (I know how bitcoin works (been using it for years), but I don't know how Circle works.), and it looks interesting, so I want to find out more (and maybe make an account)."

8277,"I've never posted here before, so sorry if this is the wrong place. I'm just...sad. You see, as the title suggests, I'm overweight. And I'm lonely. I'm just a teenager, and I've never had a girlfriend. Sure, I have great friends, but I'm still really lonely. I tell myself that I'll never find love every day. I don't like the fact, but I've come to accept it, I guess. People here at r/SelfHelp, please help me. I wouldn't say I'm depressed, although I was a few weeks ago. Everytime I see something that reminds me of the fact that I'll never find love (such as the anime Clannad, if you've heard of it), I become sad. It happened just a few minutes ago, and it was the last straw. Guys, please help me. Anything that helps you just might help me. Thanks in advance."
8278,"I think I hate these words even more than ""reach out"".  What was wrong with ""generating ideas""?"
8279,"I had an idea for a Eurostyle game where each player is an Evil Genius trying to take over a city.

Over time, these Evil Geniuses we've all seen in movies and TV become drunk with their own power.  So:

I thought a cool mechanic would be a track that your piece moves up that denotes how far insane you've gone, so the more you grow your empire or closer you get to your goals, it becomes harder for you to do certain actions or you're more susceptible to certain kinds of things.

The map would be a city, and players can build hideouts, perhaps having to ""brainwash"" citizens in order harvest what those citizens can provide.



You buy things with money, and where does money come from?  Crime.

A deck of ""crimes"" (perhaps like the deck from Elder Sign) is managed like the power plants in Power Grid as players commit crimes to gain money and henchmen, and each crime costs a certain amount.

I'd love for the interaction to be more Eurostyle and less ""go and shoot up people's hideouts"" 

Towards the end of the game, you can decide on a ""master plan"" (like the bonus purple buildings in puerto rico) that can push you over the edge for victory.

I envision each villain having a ""power"" more along the lines of comic-books than organized crime empires.

Any initial thoughts and reactions?  None of these ideas are set in stone, just fun things that got me excited about the project.

8281,"Ob

I thought i'd share with you my goodbye letter to my best friend and the words best dog, Ob.

Over the past 9 years of my life I've changed a lot. I've seen things i thought I'd never see. Done things i thought I'd never do. Felt things i thought i'd never feel. Met amazing people and made and made amazing friendships. But nothing quite like what we had.. 

 We called you OB (pronounced Obi) cause its the last two initials of our family name O'Brien. It just stuck.

  You were such an intelligent dog right from the start.. You knew how to make your own bed and you knew the sound of my car so when i came to the door you'd already be there wagging your tail like crazy waiting for me to come in.. You could even unwrap your own Christmas and birthday presents without ruining what was inside. (still amazes me to this day) 

 I'd like to take this chance to apologise for all the times i didn't bring you out for walks when you wanted to come out with me. I wasn't the best owner.. You have no idea how much i regret not spending more time with you. You were the sweetest, most caring and lovable dog in world and I'm sorry i didn't always show how much you meant to me and the family, Your family. Cause you were as much a part of this family as everyone else.. Sometimes i got mad at you for pulling on the lead when we went for walks, but you didn't get out as much as you would have liked, at least not with me. So it wasn't your fault that you were excited. I regret that more than you know.. I wish i could take you out and have you pull on the lead even just one more time.. but right now you cant even lift yourself up. You're just in too much pain.. And it kills me listening to you in that much pain knowing theres nothing i can do.
  
As of a few months back we'd tried all we can to make you better.. You're on the best food and the best medication money can buy but i fear it may not be enough anymore.. We might have to make the call in a few days depending on how you do..
 In my head, you can understand me when i talk to you.. And I'm going to read this out to you before its over. I love you. You were always willing to give your full heart to everyone you met.. You were the perfect dog, So gentle with kids and playful with me.. I feel like i let you down.. Sometimes I would come home and just give you a little pet and go upstairs.. Looking back if I would have known how soon this would come i don't know what I'd do. I'd panic, the thought of you not being there when I get home fills me with what can only be described as a perfect sadness. For in a way i know you wont be in any more pain. You deserve to be at peace more than anything.. You've given all you can give and we're so lucky to have had such an incredible dog.. such an incredible family member.. and such an incredible friend.. 

You're gonna be fine, Ob. I love you so much..

I was also given a free small popcorn which would have cost me an additional $5.00.

8300,"Spoiler alert: Catty office environment ahead

I've been working hard on my diet for several months, and I've been gradually paring down the junk food. I have one coworker in particular who seems very envious of me. In fact, she frequently spreads lies (social and professional) about me. While I have lost weight (slowly), she has gained it.

Recently, lots of junk food has been showing up in the office. All these cookies, donuts, candies, etc are placed on the table right next to me for the office to ""share"". She and I are the only two who love sugary foods. I thank her for bringing the food, then just don't eat any of it.

It is HARD. I can smell it all day every day, and some of it is stuff I really love. Recently she brought a bag off ""puppy chow"" (candy coated chex mix). I resisted it the entire time, despite smelling it constantly and being moody. She just stomped in, red faced, and grabbed it to take home with her!

8302,"I was sucked into the book fairly quickly. I was excited that he presented the mystery of the derelict fleet, the humanoid corpse named Herbie, and I was looking forward to the diverse alien species that were bound to arrive at the planet and try to capture the main characters.

I felt like the narrative was fairly descriptive of the planet, the way that dolphins interacted with humans and the starship, but from a plot point of view I felt like the middle of the book was essentially crew politics.

the last third of the novel seemed to be more interesting to me: all the maneuvers of the Streaker starship, the smaller dolphin ship, and the galactic alien fleets that were hoping to capture them.

my favorite aspect about the entire novel was most definitely the poetic dolphin communications.  

I also found the various religious and cosmological / world view of the dolphins and different races very entertaining.  

my question is: in what books do you find out about the significance of Herbie and the derelict fleet?

8330,"I have been really looking into pre-workout supplements lately to up my (fairly new) lifting game. However I few doubts/concerns about them. First off, they are rarely regulated by any quality control like the FDA and can contain harmful substances and minerals that can prove dangerous. Secondly I feel like it might be a kind of cheating. If I can only do a 'great' workout on supplements, does it really count since I can't do it on my own?

Do any of you ladies take pre-workout supplements? Does it help you further your progress even on days you don't take it? How do you choose one you trust? Thanks guys!"

8359,"I just wanted to say goodbye to everyone before I move over to /r/beyondthebump. BabyBumps has been amazing! Through all my up and downs during my pregnancy, it was nice to have an amazing group of women to turn to, even if it was just to bitch and let off some steam. You ladies are amazing and I cannot thank you enough for all of your love and support!

Now that it has been almost 2 weeks since my LO made his grand entrance, there have been a few things that I've found SUPER helpful and one or two things that I have learned along the way.

1. Crotch-sicles- Yes, you heard me right. If you have not already, go and buy yourself some pads and put some witch hazel on them and freeze them. Those first few days after a vaginal delivery I was SUPER SUPER sore (note: my kid was a whopping 10.1lbs) and these were a lifesaver.

2. If you get any stitches in your lady parts after delivery, be careful standing up. A few days ago I was getting out of bed too quickly and popped a few of those bad boys. No fun.

3. Be prepared to bleed. Alot. I'm still bleeding, but it's alot lighter than just a few days ago. I had to send out my mom to pick me up some more pads since I went through the 2 packages that I already had.

4. I know you've all heard this before, but try to sleep when your little one sleeps. This was super hard for me since my husband stayed home for a week and I felt like it was a treat for me to have him home so I didn't want to waste time napping. Big mistake. I was a zombie by day 2. Now that hubby is back to work, I find it alot easier to nap with babe.

5. Finally, ladies, take a moment to marvel at your body. You are creating life. I never truly appriciated my body until now. Every time I look at the little life my body carried, I'm completely in awe. Even though I still have loose skin on my stomach, strech marks aplenty, and leaky boobs, I love my body. Let me say that again. I LOVE MY BODY. It gave me my beautiful son, who is now the center of my universe, and who am I to not give it the credit it deserves. So whenever you are feeling fat, way too pregnant, stressed over how much weight you have gained or those strech marks, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE realize that all of it won't matter once that little one is in your arms and hopefully you will be able to look at your new after baby body and be in awe at the incredible new being that you created.

Once again, thank you guys so much for all of the support over the past 9 months. I wish all of you good health for the rest of your pregnancy and beyond.

-Stinarz 

edit: Also, I was given a bottle of dermaplast to spray on my sore lady bits after I had my son. Ladies...you need this stuff! Along with the crotch-sicles, it's like you didn""t just push out a kid...until it wears off. Do yourself and yourself and your bits a favor and have a bottle waiting on your at home.

8362,"I was told by another redditor to give the *Commonwealth Saga* by Peter F. Hamilton a chance and I completely fell in love with the story and characters, even though I got sick of reading about ""enzyme-bonded concrete.""

My favorite aspects of the books were:

- Large array of human and alien characters.
- Had some fantasy elements to it but it was not over the top (at least in my opinion.)
- The universe the books were set in was large and mysterious, with many unknowns still to be discovered.

I know that the *Void Trilogy* follows it, but I am not sure I would like it as it seems (from what I read about it) that it is a little too much fantasy for my liking. Either way, I plan to read it regardless after I finish *Rendezvous with Rama*, the book I am currently reading.

8421,"Hi /r/geology,

Hope this is an appropriate topic for this sub. I was recently doing research fieldwork (relating to water governance) on a very small atoll island in Vanuatu. During my conversations with the villagers, many of them told me that their village was struck by a pretty substantial earthquake in early 2016. They claimed since that earthquake, the water table has noticeably dropped (which they observe through their wells) and that the low tide goes much further out than it did before.

Have any of you heard of such an effect where an earthquake can noticeably shift groundwater levels and the tide? I know the tide is connected to the groundwater level because the freshwater under the atoll exists as a lens that sits on top of the saltwater, so when the tide is high it pushes the freshwater table up (which the villagers corroborated is true)."

I’m also the author of The Stranger in the Woods, about a highly intelligent man who lived alone in the forest of Maine for 27 years, as well as True Story, about my bizarre encounter with a murderer, which was adapted into a 2015 major motion picture starring James Franco and Jonah Hill.

He enjoyed the Drizzt series, & Ender's Game (these are just the ones he's told me about. I know he's read lots more), but has been reading a lot of free Kindle series lately. I'd love to hear some recommendations! TIA

Edit: many thanks everyone! I'll be researching these over the next few days. I know he started some Iain Banks, but only read the first one. He absolutely loved Firefly (so did I), so anything similar is a good bet. You guys are awesome! Thanks again!"
8431,"Here's a baseline as my starting point;

A spaceship lands tomorrow. Aliens 'step' out. CNN is on the scene.
How will/do we/the world react??

I recognize we'll differ in our opinions as to how we will react should this happen, but I'm still interested in your thoughts on which SF novel best captures the realism of such an event.

To frame it differently. In a CSI episode they encounter a dead alien... How do they react?

I always thought it would be interesting to take a regular TV show that's been running for a dozen seasons and about to be cancelled and then take a hard left and aliens land and 'enter' the show. Done seriously and not tongue in cheek or a comedy.

Thoughts?"

I colonized a continental planet and found a pre-sentient bird species living there. Ok, cool. Problem is they take three of my most beneficial tiles and colonizing has been very, very slow since.

The planet's output is terrible too now. I know I can't purge them since I'm a xenophile. Any other way to get rid of them? Because they take my tiles but I don't get anything from them, and I don't see any way to remove them.

Also, on my other planet there are primitive species enclosures that I had to give them since it was the only option. Any way to remove the natives? They're unremovable tile blockets and being a xenophile is starting to piss me off."

8445,"A thought came to me- what if, at one of your colonies, a large alien ship arrived? A quick investigation reveals it is a colony ship, full of cryogenically stored beings who were flung out from their dying world at the best speed their pre-FTL civilization could muster. 

Some thoughts:

-depending on one’s empire, you could allow some of the colonists to settle in your empire, like the current refugee mechanic,

- the refugees could have a negative trait, “Freezerburned”, that reflects their long time frozen with imperfect and primitive techniques,

-for the more xenophobic, the colonists could be spaced and the ship studied for Engineering and Society credit, and perhaps a small quantity of Food or Minerals,

-maybe, if certain tech had already been researched, the colony ship could be converted to a warship, something like the current pirate galleons,

-perhaps a chance is given to find the world of origin for these people, and a mission can be given to go see their Tomb World.

This seems like a fun exploration, along the lines of some of the things that make the More Events mod interesting."

8449,"Most of these debates are circular because they are predicted upon hostility bias. 

* Bluepill and feminists are hostile to red pill and MRAs because they threaten their cause-fighting patriarchy, abolishing gender roles and representing women's rights 

* Redpillers are hostile to blue pill and feminists because they feel threatened by it, it compromises their sexual strategy, and they are often disillusioned ex-MRAs/ex-feminists. Ditto MGTOWs

* MRAs are hostile to feminists, because they are totally disillusioned by the misandry of the 3rd wave (and sometimes redpillers for making it more difficult for feminists/BPers to sympathise with their complaints) 

Without any sense of or attempts at empathy, most thread's complaints are falling upon deaf ears.

8457,"One question that often comes up here is how the Federation (seemingly a massive multiethnic partnership of equals) seems to only be on equal terms with powers like the Klingons and the Romulans, who are presumably far more dependent on just one species.

I think we should just admit that the Federation is more like a human version of the Romulan Empire: the imperial extension of human power. This would explain why the ships are almost entirely crewed by humans, and why all major Federation installations seem to be based on Earth.

I think TOS is much more open about this, even with the Undiscovered Country dinner scene (""human rights"")."

I can believe the Klingons could develop warp technology because although violent, they are organised and have governments etc. But those other races?

BSG, Babylon 5, Farscape, Dark Matter, The Expanse, Star Trek, ect ....I can't get enough of it. I was just wondering what are some of the better Space Opera books out there? I really have to find something new to keep me busy until Babylon's Ashes comes out."

8829,"Hey guys,  
  
I'm a big fan of everything RHCP up to BSSM, and was wondering what suggestions do you have that I should listen to regarding other bands.  
  
I already listen to Primus and Fishbone, but I'd really like something more in the lines of the early RHCP.

8832,"Having no way to improve other civilizations opinion of you must be fixed. Every single time I play, it seems all AI are Hostile or unfriendly, regardless of my traits and government. Yet they all get along with each other and form huge defensive pacts with each other until they can form federations. It is exhausting.

8 Games in a row now, I've had 2-5 civilization 'teams' all gang up on my Civ and completely murder me after 3-5 hours of building. I am starting to lose any enjoyment out of this."

Im specifically looking for books where a character creates artificial lifeforms(digital or biological) that become/are sentient and build a civilization."
8836,"Forget the price and functionality. Do you like how it looks?
 Personally I find it a bit too Dorrito shaped... 

For me, that whole flying wing, triangle design of the Polaris, Hurricane, Avenger and Eclipse is rather uninspired; even if the Avenger and Eclipse pull it off somewhat owing to their similarities to the real world designs for stealth bombers and space shuttles.

8841,"I've had no success so far in landing my Scythe/Reaver when it's on fire. No matter how slowly and carefully i bring it down, it explodes instantly upon touching the ground. I've tried it on landing pads, angles and flat ground, and it explodes every single time. I've also tried jumping out of it before it touches, which still results in a waste of 250 air resources. Is there something I'm missing? I'm mainly a lib pilot and have never had this issue landing a lib."

8864,I've been in the realm of fantasy most of my life and I can't help but notice that SF series tend to be very short in book numbers as well as page numbers.

However, Stone Age civs cant be observed, so I'm wondering if they can ever evolve on their own to the point where you could uplift them? Or should I just change policies and wipe them out to take the planets, since I cant even make use of them as is?"

I have an undergrad in PPE from Durham and currently work as an economist for a trade body. I'm looking at doing an online Masters with SOAS in Economics. It would cost less than what I could borrow via the postgraduate loan and then I think (please correct me if I'm wrong), I pay 6% on earnings above £21,000. 

So, how would you value it?"

9388,"I've always been a huge proponent of bad movies and hate-watching tv series, and that lads me to wonder... are there any podcasts like that? Shows that are train wrecks, but you can't stop listening?"

9391,"1. Is magical ability determined by biological make-up (i.e. is it hereditary)? If so, can it be controlled (i.e. eugenics)
2. Can magic effect the DNA make up of someone? Can a spell cause an effect in a person and become hereditary (i.e. giving someone two heads and then there kids would have two heads).
"
9392,"I remember at the end of Hyperion Cantos there were glimpses at a future where humans came in all shapes, sizes, and colours. And in Niven's Ringworld there is the free love-esque concept of rishathra.

How would the tectonic plates move to form supercontinents or break up said supercontinents? Wouldn't they get in the way of each other?"

So which storys (here in HFY or -external- published novels) do you know with a heavy or main focus in the romantic relationship of a male human and a female xeno?

Not too strong but not too weak.

Not too big but not too small.

Not too smart but not too dumb.

Adaptation? Ingenuity?"

And unrelated question, how do I set up sectors, and do they not count against my core system cap?"

Our guild has a Mistweaver Monk healer and unfortunately he is lagging considerably behind our other healers in terms of healing which often requires me to sit him on fights past 9/13M

It may have been because rid the depression I had. Me being Melachonly basically unhealthy mind state delve into all this like thought about many things. 


To note many great creators were very mealachonly and pears also. Abraham Lincoln was very mealachonly I read he wouldn't dare walk around with a knife in his pocket or something like that. 


And I feel that many INFJ just couldn't make it to a healthy INFJ mind and wind up being like crazy unruly in nature because they forget to change their perspectives. 


And I feel that every INFJ like we're always one since the beginning. Certain things always stood out to me. From Johnny Appleseed and like certain behaviors stood out to me probably because I took it all in as a observer and not like just get mad or something. 


But it's a lot to explain and convey correctly. But I want to know if any of you are ever torn between saving the world or forsakening it.

10097,"Hi all-

hoping for a quick primer or some recommendations on JPOP as I've recently fallen in love with BABYMETAL due to the catchy choruses and sense of fun in the music- not necessarily the metal aspect, so I'm not looking for the hard rock/metal stuff exclusively.  I like- catchy choruses and female leads.

Any recommendations to get started or other resources? Thanks."

Just brainstorming, ways to reverse this 
1. Shorten hours of Immigration checkpoint 
2. Liberalize Brunei, so there is less need to take a ""break"" in Miri
3. Government weaken the Brunei currency
Other ideas?

So I realized that there's not any pieces with good stats for Mistweaver, meaning hardly anything with multistrike in Highmaul. I'm not sure if I should be taking upgrades in normal highmaul or keep my 630 gear for the multistrike. Does anyone have a list of BiS gear for MW, or am I kinda just choosing second and third stats.

Thanks. fellow redditor.

Edit below to provide more info... 

hmmm... i guess i will put down the original problem here.
Background: cargo industry use a container (ULD number) to store shipment (AWB number) and shipment come in different pieces count. Inbound flight to cargo terminal, it will require to break down and rebuilt by mixing with different cargo to the same destination and uplift into the outbound flight. Some containers require no touching. I need to find out the unit being untouched.
Simplified version!! The data in the data warehouse organize like below. 

ULD no| AWB | pieces | type

12345 | a | 9 | arrival

12345 | b | 2 | arrival

22222 | c | 1 | arrival

12345 | a | 9 | departure

12345 | b | 2 | departure

Inbound flight and outbound flight we both find a unit

12345|a,9:b,2

we can say this is untouched.
So basically i need to stack the awb number to create a new unique ID for container... ID being container number what in the awb and pieces as well.
Right now i do the stacking of awbs under container in the excel. Results are making business sense. It might not be 100% close to reality due to operational reason but we are okay to accept this result.
I was wondering if there is any smarter way to do this."

**Referee:** Mario Melero López

 

---------------------------

---------------------------

 

**Match Events**

0' - [](#icon-whistle) Kick off!

2' - Iniesta with a cross in, Levante not sure who should clear it, but no Barca player near enough to cause trouble.

4' - Beautiful one-touch combination in and around the area ends with Iniesta taking a shot that's easy to save.

5' - Coutinho a bit lucky to get to a return ball from Suarez, keeps it in the area but has too many defenders on him in the end.

6' - Suarez takes a free-kick into the wall, Iniesta sends it back in for Mina who is well offside.

9' - [](#icon-ball"") **[GOAL! BOATENG!](https://streamable.com/g9cna)** Morales tanks himself through the defence, sends the ball in the middle where Boateng is completely free to tap it in.

11' - And nearly the second for Levante as Barca's defence is all over the place. Luckily the crossbar saves.

20' - [](#icon-yellow"") **yellow** Vermaeln, for a foul on Boateng.

22' - [](#icon-yellow"") **yellow** Bardhi, for a foul on Semedo.

25' - Coutinho on a run, finds Suarez, on to Dembele who has his shot deflected to a corner.

27' - Vermaelen intercepts a counter, but holds his hamstring, not good.

29' - Coutinho whips in a free-kick to the far post where Oier jumps into Suarez and gets the free-kick.

30' - [](#icon-ball"") **[GOAL! BOATENG!](https://streamable.com/7g4cf)** Barca down to 10, no one manages to get the ball out of defence and Boateng goes around Ter Stegen, crashes into Semedo and puts in his second.

32' - [](#icon-sub"") Pique on for Vermaelen (1/3).

37' - [](#icon-yellow"") **yellow** Boateng, for grabbing Mina's face.

38' - [](#icon-ball"") **[GOOOOOOOL!!! COUTINHO!!!](https://streamable.com/xfim5)** Pique in striker mode, drives the ball forward, Coutinho gets the ball, takes a few steps to get into position and bends the ball perfectly into the net.

43' - Barca pressing hard the last 10 minutes creating a lot of chances.

43' - Oier jumps into Suarez again and again gets a free-kick.

44' - Semedo goes down in the area, no call. Replay shows it was definitely not a penalty.

45' - On the other end Levante wants a handball penalty, but Pique had his hand by the side and gets hit by the ball. Good call by the ref to not give a penalty.

[](#icon-clock) **HALFTIME**

46' - No changes at half-time.

46' - [](#icon-ball"") **[GOAL! BARDHI!](https://streamable.com/rdul8)** Levante very quick from intercepting a ball to getting to the area and Bardhi is left with way too much space to score a beautiful goal.

50' - [](#icon-ball"") **[HATTRICK! BOATENG!](https://streamable.com/tr1nr)** Barca's defence all over the place once more as Levante walks all over them.

56' - [](#icon-ball"") **[GOAL!  BARDHI!](https://streamable.com/m1n4a)** Another counter, another goal. Mina, Alba and Busquets nowhere near Bardhi as he gets the ball and scores his second of the night.

58' - [](#icon-ball"") **[GOOOOL!!! COUTINHO!!](https://streamable.com/kknn7)** Dembele into the area, picks out Coutinho who has some space and pulls one back. Three to go.

60' - [](#icon-sub"") Denis on for Iniesta (2/3).

60' - [](#icon-sub"") Paco on for Dembele (3/3).

62' - [](#icon-yellow"") **yellow** Coke, for a foul on Coutinho.

64' - [](#icon-ball"") **[HATTRICK!!!!!! COUTINHO!!!](https://streamable.com/ggwpo)** Denis sends a free-kick into the area, cleared away, Busquets wins it and picks out Coutinho who scores one more! TWO TO GO!

65' - [](#icon-yellow"") **yellow** Busquets, for a foul on Morales.

68' - Barca is pressing hard, pushing Levante deep into their own area.

69' - [](#icon-sub"") Lerma on for Roger (1/3).

69' - **PENALTY!!!** Corner into the area and Busquets is brought down from behind by Campana.

70' - [](#icon-yellow"") **yellow** Campana, for the foul.

71' - [](#icon-ball"") **[GOOOOL!!! SUAREZ!!!](https://streamable.com/ev7kz)** Suarez hammers the ball right down the middle and Barca only needs 1 more to bring the game level!

73' - Suarez with a huge miss! Denis sends a free-kick into the area right to Suarez who sends his header too high.

75' - Levante with a chance again, but the ball into the middle is easily intercepted by Ter Stegen.

76' - Another chance for Barca as Denis has his shot deflected, but instead of a corner a Suarez offside was called for whatever reason.

77' - [](#icon-sub"") Pazzini on for Boateng (2/3).

79' - Mina does well to give Morales no space and clears for a corner.

81' - Morales with a huge run as he gets through four defenders, but the finishing is weak.

82' - Nealry the equaliser as Alba's cross is nearly put into the net by a Levante player.

82' - Busquets wants a second penalty for a handball, but it was nothing.

85' - [](#icon-sub"") Rochina on for Morales (3/3).

87' - Suarez down in the area and gets into Lemars face who pushes back, yellow for both.

88' - [](#icon-yellow"") **yellow** Lemar.

88' - [](#icon-yellow"") **yellow** Suarez.

89' - [](#icon-yellow"") **yellow** Denis, for complaining.

90' - Busquets nearly gifts Rochina the winning goal, but luckily he sends it wide.

90+2' - Ter Stegen with a long ball to Pique, lays it off to Suarez who goes for the dribble instead of shooting.

90+3' - [](#icon-yellow"") **yellow** Pazzini, arguing.

90+3' - Oier jumps into Pique and Mina, once more gets protected.

90+4' - [](#icon-yellow"") **yellow** Pique, for arguing.

90+4' - [](#icon-yellow"") **yellow** Mina, for a foul.

10963,"Since I was at school I have found the universe created by Peter F Hamilton for the commonwealth saga so easy to become immersed in as it is so detailed and rich in its depth and breadth. 
What other created universes have his effect on people where they just feel completely a part of the universe while reading? "

10965,"Coming back from the expanse and reminding myself of arrival, I feel an urge to delve into the consciousness of otherworldly being, weird life forms, not necessarily humanoid (actually even more so). Need stuff that bends mind (Solaris type) or explore the relation that can develop, the reaction, to an alien life form, repercussions on perception and civilisation, may it be over time (I have vague but nice souvenir of Foundation Cycle). Anyway, if you got anything to feed me, please do, thanks"

10968,"Looking at modern times, it looks like unmanned drones are and will be used much into the future of warfare. How come the UNSC doesn't utilize them in their war against the Covenant? Or are they just not in the games? "
10969,"I spotted a juicy planet with pre-sentient pops that have 100% tomb worlds habitability, but my empire ethics prevent me from uplifting them.  Can I invade them by force and capture them?"
10970,"I know its the denver subreddit but I live here and was looking for advice! We are headed to durango for a few days and were wondering if anyone knew a good trail for some backpacking. We arent looking to summit any peaks. We like meadows and wild flowers and trees. Hoping for a 2 day trip, less than 20 miles. Anyone have any suggestions?"
10971,"I recently finished all of Jim Butcher's Dresden Files novels and they were a blast, in no small part thanks to James Marster's superb readings. I tried to keep going with Urban Fantasy but got bored with the first few I tried (Irondruid, Sandman Slim, Felix Castor). I'm leaning, now, towards the scifi end of the spectrum. I really liked all the novels in the Expanse series by James S. A. Corey and would be interested in recommendations down that vein. Thanks!"
10972,"I am looking to upgrade my home work station. I am leaning toward the www.upliftdesk.com reclaimed teak desk. 
I wanted to ping the hive and see what is in fashion these days. I would love to see what people are using. Any ideas would be great.
I will say this, I am not a fan of monitor bridges. I am just strange that way I guess."
10973,"Just curious, I'm personally a huge fan of Savior from californication but there's a few others that i love"
10974,
10975,"Best 4 man team you can come up with in the show. For me I would take Shane- Crazy but real talented with Zombies
Glen(Before Maggie)- Quick and agile, good scout
New Rick- Even crazier than Shane
Darrell(Of Course)- Natural hunter and very loyal to his people "
10976,"I'm enjoying all of these responses, some a varied and well thought out.

EDIT: Well, this topic exploded. It was nice (and tiring actually) to read all the insightful answers I got! Thanks everyone for sharing!"
10977,"The same thing with mars, that he couldnt even conquer.
"
10978,I learned that this side effects is due to GABA A alpha 5 subunit that some benzodiazepines binds to. How to prevent from that negative GABA A agonists effects? Antagonise alpha 5 subunit or maybe there a benzodiazepine that don't impact on this subunit?
10979,"Other than negative ethics divergence, which is kind of difficult, what possible ways are there to modify ethics?

Also I'm absolutely in love with genetic engineering. It's so cool! I can't wait to gently begin to min max- or play as a truly authoritarian empire and absolutely optimise my workforce."
10980,Hope everyone is having a great weekend! I just wanted to see if there were any folks here that have tried GoE's new Grandfather line or any other white strains for that matter.. I see reviews on the other subreddit but they are few and far in between and have read both very good and very bad reviews on their leaf. I wanna see what y'all have to say about it before I make a decision on what to pick up :D thanks for reading~ EDIT: Neeeevermind!

10982,"I was looking to go into the construction field upon graduation and some of the jobs available to me are Site Coordinator, project coordinator, etc. For those of you who work in that field, how do you guys enjoy it? How are the hours and pay? How do you deal with temporary layoffs during the winter when there's no work? I'll have a diploma in Civil Engineering Tech and I'm shooting for a B.Tech in Construction Management."
10983,"So I’m curious to know what you guys think about Attack zone buffs?

Yes I’m aware it stacks with Attack buffs but I really don’t know how powerful they are or weather or not they are a huge difference maker.

I think it’s unique in that you need to stay in that designated zone to get it.

Yes I’m aware that these idols have slow ss3 "

10985,"I want stories that involve future Earth uplifting primitive alien races in their own respective Industrial Revolution period/Medieval period, or a One-Man Industrial Revolution TVTrope type thing. Halo or OC!Humanity would be great, thanks :D"
10986,"I see varied opinions, some measured, some from blinkered fans but I was just wondering what the overall feeling was towards the BCCI?"
10987,Seeing a lot of people praise Mistlock Sanctuary here lately. I chose not to purchase it when it was available since I already have the Terrace scroll. Can someone tell me why Mistlock is so much better than all the others?

10989,"I'd like to try a /r/AskReddit style thread for this sub. I tried AskReddit about a month ago and I got complete radio silence. I thought since all the entrepreneurs are clustered on this sub, it's a much better place to ask.

Here are some questions I have.

1. What do you do exactly?
2. How did you get started?
3. Do you enjoy it?
4. Do you consider it a success?
5. What are your plans for the future?

Any other info you would like to add would be great!"
10990,"It would be a good way to motivate general people to take action, even those normally outside of politics who are displeased with him, and his former supporters.

I didn't come up with it, I saw it on a sign a long time ago and the phrase stuck with me since."
10991,"It seems to me that the tags Prog House, Big Room or Electro House pretty much apply to any electronic music nowadays.

Anyone cares to clarify with exemples (you can't use Pryda or Eric Prydz for Prog house)?"
10992,
10993,"What kind of mindset does it take to conquer an entire planet, knowing that billions would die in the process? Even the ""nice"" ones like Vulcan were willing to exterminate populations who resisted compliance or were thought to be corrupted. Since these creatures were specifically built for war, are their emotions suppressed in some way in order to do those things without hesitation? "
10994,error
10995,"Note: I'm not asking whether or not you think polyamory is morally justifiable. Perhaps there's someone who does think this, but I doubt they would be in the r/Christianity community. What I'm asking is HOW you would respond if you had to use an evangelistic/apologetic type argument and not just a quick and easy scriptural proof-text which satisfies you but won't persuade the other person if they don't recognize the same canonical authority you do."
10996,"Is there anything out there that is remotely similar to The Expanse.  I think The Expanse has ruined all other science fiction for me.  

I've tried a few different books by different authors and I just can't get into them the way I did with The Expanse.  Before The Expanse I read the Dark Tower series.  It consumed me for about a year until I was finished.  "

Fatlogic in real life getting you down?

Is your family telling you you're looking too thin?

Are people at work bringing you donuts?

Did your beer drinking neighbor pat his belly and tell you ""It's all muscle?""

If you hear one more thing about starvation mode will you scream?

Let it all out. We understand.

11004,"I've been thinking about doing a small ADF tank and also a small shrimp tank and I realized it would probably be easier to just buy a 10 Gallon kit and a divider. 5 Gallons for a colony of RCS and 5 gallons for a group of ADFs.

Both species would be happy at room temperature as well, right? Low-to-mid 70s? 

Any reason why this wouldn't work?"
11005,"I need some more cultural diversity in my playlist. There are two Japanese bands that I listen to (ONE OK ROCK and Peanuts for a Party Boy), but I learned that the latter is breaking up, and I'm on the hunt for new stuff in a similar vain to these two bands to keep them from getting stale (less worried about ONE OK ROCK sounding bands, something more pop punk/easycore)"
11006,"Like many of you, I'm sure, I currently have around a $3k set-up sitting on a $40 Ikea desk. I'd like to step up to something bigger and sturdier. I'm thinking about using a butchers block for a desktop and using my ikea legs. So I ask you guys and girls, what type of desks are you using? If you have any links, please share."
11007,"[Dx11 vs dx12 fury X and 980ti](http://www.extremetech.com/gaming/231481-rise-of-the-tomb-raider-async-compute-update-improves-performance-on-amd-hardware-flat-on-maxwell)

It looks like dx12 is finally worth using for amd getting us closer to having similar performance to dx11 on nvidia."

I look forward to your responses. "

11011,Playing as a xenophile and I settled a planet with pre-sentient species on it. What do I do? They take up a quarter of the tiles and I can't move them or purge them or anything. I want to fix it or abandon the planet alltogether and leave them be. How do I do this?
11012,"Hi folks,

Is there any dumpsite where I can throw away some old wooden doors? They're not in a good state, so they are no use for nobody.

Thanks"
11013,[deleted]
11014,So I just uplifted some species and even tho I use hyper lanes they use wormholes. Seems kind of stupid that they get tech I don't have when I'm the one who's teaching them all the necessary techs to become a space faring species.
11015,"Recently became eligible for MR23 and I was going through my codex, and this black spot on it is driving me crazy.

I contacted support and they say there's nothing they can do, yet were able to replay all the new quest.

This seems like it would be an easy fix, at least let people complete it if they haven't yet."
11016,I'm a big fan of Elizabeth Moon. I wondered if anyone else wrote scifi with a military feel like she has in her books?
11017,An example I can think of I guess is Panda diplomacy 
11018,"I has only been to PAX South and found the bunch of indie game exhibit there. It is a great place to give your game some exposure. What other similar gaming conferences that you guys recommend? On the top of my head, there are these:

+ PAX (South, East, West)
+ GameCom
+ GDC
+ Retropalooza?
+ IndiCade?

What am I missing out? I'm mainly interested in checking out project from other indie dev team, networking with people in the industry and renting a booth to show our studio's work."
