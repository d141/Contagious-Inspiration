I'm curious as to what your thoughts are on the tendency of the human mind and maybe particularly the drug induced mind, to be apt to pattern recognition. Especially when it relates to mythologies and archetypes, it seems that this pattern recognition mechanism is in overdrive, seeking to mentally resolve the salient subject: the mythology or archetype in question. Given the depth of research you have done and the corpus of stories that float around in your mind, what is your perception on this pattern recognition mechanism of the mind as it relates to either your own decisions and beliefs regarding this subject -- or to us collectively? In addition how do you see the alteration of this mechanism as a result of drug use?After reading a good majority of the comments in this thread, I got to thinking how incredible it would be to have a timeline style global visualization of the general sequence of events and a visual representation of the spread of the world's stories and mythologies. Imagine Google Earth, including a geographically accurate early-Earth (to our best understanding) and data for the various communities and civilizations over time, including: mythologies, texts, cultures, nations, island-bridges, and locations. I have several philosophy of religions texts that have some basic timelines of the influence of religions, but one like this constrained on a map and regarding the subject of mythology would be amazing.

Spinning crane kick is shit now though, and is only useful on burn phases where it's feasable to stack. The mana cost is simply too high, with little return on Chi.Tank healing is decent. Life Cocoon is an amazing CD, but it's hard to figure out when to use it unless your tank is extremely vocal about cooldown rotations. Surging mist is a mana dump, so it needs to be avoid at all costs unless you feel like going for the free surge from spamming tiger palm. (not worth it seriously, the jab cost is insane high). Enveloping Mists is a great heal, but you need to grab the chi for it extremely fast if it's needed. Generally I can get soothing mist to proc enough for it.TLDR; Monks need to keep tanks topped off at all times to be at all viable. Cocoon is the only mana efficient recovery method.Utiity is shit. Revival is a nice cooldown, but it's sudden, and it's used to keep the lowest in health from death. At times, that means overhealing others by 33%. Single target healing is extremely viable. Far better than healing wave, heal, etc. It can't overheal. It's almost impossible.PLaying a monk properly is a huge skill gap.

A couple of hours later, happenstance found a guy coming in (I was working at a gas station, so these were two separate customers) with a Southern Brotherhood tattoo (it looked too nice to be your typical prison scratching). I thought \"I wonder what the first artist (assuming he had a fondness\/connection for Jewish history\/culture\/religion\/ethnicity, would say had that second guy come in and asked to get that tattoo?

She measures 36\" underbust, 37\" overbust. We recently tried on some 36As in several different brands, but the band was actually too small on all of them. She'd prefer a push-up style, as she doesn't have much breast tissue and push-ups make it appear as though she has more (she's a transwoman and in the first stages of transitioning, so she may have more breast tissue in the future. Its hard to say at this point, as she just started HRT). Is there anywhere we could find decent padded bras in a 38AA to order and try? 36\" bands just are not working, she could not even make the ends meet, despite her underbust measurement.
