She lived in the house for 30 years before I moved in. This is the story of our recovery to cleanliness and simplicity.","selftext":" My mom is my best friend, a brilliant student, a gifted psych nurse, and an incredible sweet beautiful person, but good grief the house. She's healthy, smart, kind, and funny, but oh god the house. Words fail. It's on a half acre of trees and her hoarding covered the whole lot. inside and out. The city sent blight notices and threats of fines and things were escalating.\n\nShe was always what we would call, \"cluttery\" - picking up things like golf balls, pretty glass, or unusual stones on a walk. But she also took my great-grandmother's lessons from the Depression and her own youth in poverty to heart - so she hoarded rubber bands, prescription bags, envelopes, paper (Oh god the paper), etc. She was a psychiatric nurse specializing in pediatrics, she is a literacy tutor, self-taught mystic and botanist, and origami teacher - so there was paper, thousands of books, bag after bag of toys of all kinds, medical texts, everything you could possibly imagine. She loved to shop at Goodwill and yard sales when she was lonely, bringing home stray furniture, clothes, toys, and always stacks of books. Ten years ago my dad died and in her grief things got much worse. It took years for her to recover, and eventually she bought a little house in the woods to retire to. \n\nMy mom moved to a small hippie community in the woods and once there her social group grew, she became more active and healthy, her heart began to heal, and she stopped her compulsive buying. Once she was secure there she gave me permission to clean up the house. She said she wanted to clean up but was totally overwhelmed and didn't even know where or how to start.\n\nWhen I moved in two years ago, each room had a corridor through the six foot high collections and trash through which you could navigate very carefully. The lights were out, the wallboard unfinished, the house stank of cat and dog urine. The yard was incredible, the trees overgrown, the house was in ruins.\n\nMy boyfriend and I have worked so hard the last couple years. I started outside so the city would get off my back. I mulched the yard in two feet of wood mulch to smother the grass, went crazy with my saber saw on the trees, and my boyfriend and I did dozens of dump loads in his truck. We divided the yard into sections and just started throwing away everything that wasn't essential. I built a big cinderblock firepit and we had burns every weekend for the heaps of wood and paper. That took most of the first year. We lived in the back room sleeping on top of the spa on a mattress, no other room was liveable. \n\nThen I started in the house. I set a goal of one room per month, but had to scale back to two rooms per season because the city limited what I could put out for trash at one time and sent me letters if I put the trash in my driveway in between pickups. Local scrappers took furniture and metal. The school up the road got boxes of books, paper, and art supplies. The firepit and garbage and recycling bin got more than I will ever admit. \n\nI put in place a couple of rules:\n1. If it doesn't get used in six months, it's gone. \n2. No furniture unless it's quality, and only if needed. \n3. I have to be able to keep up the house by myself- so the simpler the better. \n4. No upgrades- just stripping away, repairs, and cleaning. (preventing Money Pit Syndrome.) Drywall is being built, fences, bright new lights, new paint - room by room I'm fixing it up, simplifying, baring down to something simple and clean. The yard is better and better, the house has beautiful bones and is so bright and pretty now. It's still an old house, but it's a sane house finally.\n\nMy mom comes to visit a few times a year and is so thankful to me. I don't have to pay rent. :) I just keep cleaning and simplifying the house, throwing things away and cleaning and painting as I go. She has a house now, we have a working hot tub, a woodshop, a metal shop, a little forge and garden, the animals are clean and healthy, the yard looks great, we can have guests over, and I can keep up with it. There's still a lot to do, I have a five year plan. My goal is to be able to rent or sell the property if I want to move. The way it was it might have been scraped or condemned and it's a beautiful old house.\n\nI'm writing this because I just kind of finished - I cleaned out my mom's room yesterday. It took seventeen trash bags. I've never seen her room look like this in my life. This was the last room of The Crazy, and I fought to keep her photos and tchotchkes preserved while stripping and cleaning it. When she comes in a few days it will be my surprise to her - her personal space is big, bright, clean and liveable now. I can't wait to see her face.\n\nMinimalism isn't just a philosophy to me - it'a love letter to my mom, a renewal of a valuable material resource, a battle against my mom's grief and loneliness, and  part of my mission to better myself and my family so we can have a good future. We're winning with every room cleaned and emptied. One of the rooms is our own bright clean little bedroom now.  :)\n\nThanks for reading.

So a large amount of us decided that if we wanted to leave a mark in our school, we would do it through pranks.\n\nThe first was headed by this one guy. He gathered a bag full of dog shit, and told every senior to leave class at a certain time. We left, and locked windows and doors from the outside, and fled the scene. The guy had packed the bag into a cafeteria microwave and set it for 3 minutes. We hear that it smelled absolutely horrid. This was the fall back plan of the original plan, however. We were originally going to set a bunch of skunks free in the school and lock everybody inside, but the skunks escaped before we could use them.\n\nThe second prank was done by the artsy group, which included me. We sneaked into the school after it had closed, and painted the windows of the office in black and red, and I drew a small comical thing of Hitler. The school raged, of course, which made us want to go a step further, and change all the flags in the school into swastika flags. Though we acquired a few swastika flags, we never really got around to doing that prank.\n\nThe third was inspired by us. A bunch of guys sneaked into the school a month or so later, and the painted every single locker with either pink, orange, or black. They then greased up the floors, and painted \"Grad 2009\" on the wall of the main gymnasium.\n\nThe fourth was relatively simple. It snowed early that year, and by a crapload, so we just packed all the snow on every door, chained up the main entrance and packed snow up to the door handles. The result was a satisfactory day off while the custodians and teachers cleared the doors.\n\nThe last one was just childish and a little boring. We just downloaded a shit-ton of porn onto every school computer, made the home page a gay porn website. The wallpaper was also gay porn, and the screen savers were gay porn. It affected the library the most, and for most of the day the computers were unavailable for use.\n\nI heard that a lot of crap was done at the prom, but I didn't really see what they did. However, according to students still in our high school, a great deal of school events are permanently discontinued because we were such douchebags.\n\nOh, and those pranks were just the ones I either helped do or was at least indirectly in on. Through a few of my friends I learned there were a lot of minor ones that I don't know about. We also planned on putting anal lube in cafeteria food, but decided it was too weak and boring. We didn't even know what that would do. It's not like we knew what anal lube tasted like.","score_com":0,"title":"What was your senior prank?","selftext":"","score":304},"27":{"subreddit":"worldnews","id":"15q0a5","comment_body":"Good for them; Christian Bale wasn't able to get past security when he went to see Chen Guangcheng.

I think that people as wealthy as you with the gift of inspiring the imagination, and ability to encourage people to do their own research would be well fit to be a teacher. It is clear to me in this thread that your passion about this subject is a wonderfully strong force that I'd like to encourage.\n\nI saw at one point you mentioned in a matter-of-fact way that drug use was a part of your life. I'm curious as to what your thoughts are on the tendency of the human mind and maybe particularly the drug induced mind, to be apt to pattern recognition. Especially when it relates to mythologies and archetypes, it seems that this pattern recognition mechanism is in overdrive, seeking to mentally resolve the salient subject: the mythology or archetype in question. Given the depth of research you have done and the corpus of stories that float around in your mind, what is your perception on this pattern recognition mechanism of the mind as it relates to either your own decisions and beliefs regarding this subject -- or to us collectively? In addition how do you see the alteration of this mechanism as a result of drug use?\n\nAfter reading a good majority of the comments in this thread, I got to thinking how incredible it would be to have a timeline style global visualization of the general sequence of events and a visual representation of the spread of the world's stories and mythologies. Imagine Google Earth, including a geographically accurate early-Earth (to our best understanding) and data for the various communities and civilizations over time, including: mythologies, texts, cultures, nations, island-bridges, and locations. I have several philosophy of religions texts that have some basic timelines of the influence of religions, but one like this constrained on a map and regarding the subject of mythology would be amazing.

Even though Halo 3 looks like bollocks compared to what we have now, gunning through the jungles of Africa with the Arbiter on a big HD TV was awe inspiring at the time.  \n\n\n\nFallout 3 is another game where the intro was mind blowing. Even with my piece of shit graphics card, stepping out of the vault and seeing the wasteland was one of the greatest feelings I've ever had in a videogame.  \n\n\n\nThe first level of Pikmin 2 was another great opening that really sticks out in my mind. Even though it isn't particularly special, it's the fact that it was the first time I had ever played a next-gen game (last gen now). Before playing Pikmin 2, I had pretty much no exposure to modern (2005) gaming. I had no internet and I wasn't subscribed to any game magazines so I had no idea what to expect. In fact, I had no idea what the hell Pikmin 2 was about. The only reason I bought it was because it was $50 and in my mind that meant it was obviously a good game (luckily I was right).

I had no idea I was so prolific.\n\nHopefully it's quantity AND quality. :)\n\nHonestly, this is one of my absolute favorite subreddits. The content is outstanding. The mods have always been a pleasure to deal with. The depth and breadth of knowledge available to tap into at any given moment is at once intimidating and inspiring.\n\nWhen I first got here, I was probably more on the intimidated side, feeling terribly out of my league and woefully ignorant, coming from a non-professional background with no formal training of any kind. Heck, the most I was taught about cooking, as I was growing up, was how to read and follow the directions on a box of Hamburger Helper.\n\nYears down the road, my tastes finally starting to mature, I start to realize that, hey, this vegetable thing isn't so bad. I should figure out how to do something more than just steam them for a side dish. Next thing I know, I'm burning and scorching my way through the kitchen, undercooking, overcooking overseasoning, ignoring recipes, and hacking away with grim resolve at any unfortunate food that had the bad luck to cross my cutting board\n\nFor a few months there, you'd think I was attending Acad\u00e9mie de L'imb\u00e9cile, Institute of the Culinary Arts for the Criminally Insane and Woefully Inept.\n\nThen, one fateful evening, I was preparing to defile a perfectly good recipe, that had never done anything to anyone and really didn't deserve the treatment it was about to receive, then feed the resulting carnage to the poor souls who have the unwavering courage, utmost dedication, or possibly some sort of brain damage resulting in them no longer having the primal fight-or-flight instinct to ensure their well-being, to call themselves not just my friends...but my dinner guests.\n\nThe fools.\n\nSo, there I am, looking over this recipe, and it calls for onions to be sauteed.\n\nMoment of clarity: I don't actually know what that means. I bet I could look it up on the internet.\n\nAnd lo, the heavens parted, choirs sang, and God looked down upon the dinner I had prepared sayeth unto me in all his glory, \"Well. That didn't suck.\"\n\nAnd thus began my self-education in the ways of making food that doesn't suck. Started with the basics and learned fundamental concepts. What is boiling vs simmering? What is braising vs roasting vs baking. What essential items should I always have in my kitchen?\n\nJust learning core concepts and putting them into practice stretched me for quite a while. Then I played with baked goods for a while, and then started playing around with dishes from other cultures that were outside of my comfort zone.\n\nThen I hit a plateau. I found myself frustrated that I had learned how to apply all these wonderful methods and techniques, but I didn't know why. It was skill without theory. I wanted a deeper understanding of the what\/how\/why of all these tasks I had learned how to perform.\n\nAnd then a friend introduced me to Alton Brown and Good Eats. So there's another year and a half or more of my life.\n\nFinally, early in 2012, I discover this little site called Reddit. There was the initial honeymoon phase of memes, nifty pics, jokes, and the typical front page material. I kept noticing this ad on the front page for some subreddit called AskCulinary. Braving this new world of meaningful content, I forged ahead and figured out how to subscribe. It was my first custom subreddit and the best decision I've made since joining the site.\n\nAfter a short period of lurking, getting a feel for posting guidelines, and waiting for the opportunity, I made my first post and was absolutely blown away by the response. People were friendly and knowledgeable. They knew the right questions to ask to get further detail from me so they could better assist me. There was a genuine interest in not just food, or recipes, or cooking in general, but in helping others to not just resolve their cooking issues, but educate them along the way, providing breakdowns of the science, explanations of theory, links to external relevant information, and a consistently positive attitude.\n\nIt's like having Alton Brown on-call for troubleshooting, education, and inspiration, pretty much 24 hours a day. Even at ridiculously late hours of the night, I don't think I've ever waited more than an hour for a response to a post.\n\nSo, yeah, I post here all the bloody time. You guys successfully got me through this last summer's project\/goal of learning how to grill, maybe not like a pro, but a hell of a lot better than most, and how to effectively use the grill as a smoker. It's something I've wanted to do for years and the AskCulinary crew played a major role in helping to facilitate the accomplishment of that goal.\n\nIf anyone actually bothers to read the entirety of this totally ridiculous, rambling, partially nonsensical comment, I hope that you come away with a sense that no matter what your current level of knowledge or amount of skill in the kitchen may be, AskCulinary provides an invaluable resource to enable you to become a better cook every day. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Don't feel like you're questions have to involve high end cooking or advanced techniques.\n\nThere are no Stupid Questions.

We hope you all find our community a great place to share culinary knowledge.\n\nWith our rapid increase in size we feel it would be beneficial to explain to the newcomers and remind our regulars what \/r\/askculinary is all about.\n\nWe are, as the title of the community states, here to share our knowledge and to help each other become better cooks. To accomplish this goal, we do have rules to encourage quality posts and comments. I would like to clarify and reiterate our rules and guidelines here.\n\n**Most importantly, we are not here for recipes.** There is nothing wrong with sharing your recipes, but there are better and larger subreddits like \/r\/recipes and \/r\/cooking that specialize in this sort of thing. If your posts primary goal is to receive a good recipe or to use a particular ingredient for a particular dish, you will be better off posting in either of those subreddits. Specific, detailed questions to which we can give specific, detailed answers serve our overall goals much more.\n\nIn addition, **casual culinary discussion and kitchen stories are better suited to other communities** such as\/ \/r\/kitchenconfidential, \/r\/cooking or \/r\/chefit. Posts asking for career advice, such as what school to go to or how to get into the industry are better suited to \/r\/kitchenconfidential or \/r\/chefit. Casual questions like, \u201cWhat is your favorite thing to cook?\u201d or \u201cWhat is something cheap and easy to make?\u201d are better suited to \/r\/cooking. These questions get better response in other more general communities.\n\nThere is also a new rule that we became aware of. **Any post that is asking whether or not a dish is safe to consume could be construed as medical advice. This is against Reddit's site-wide ToS and thus will be removed immediately.** I know it seems foolish to have to be this extreme, but it's important, besides which, there is only one appropriate answer to the question: \"If in doubt, throw it out\"\n\n**We have a great FAQ and archive to search of previously answered questions.** Please use these to avoid reposting questions that have been thoroughly answered. Yes, it is more fun to have a conversation, but frequently repeated basic questions is what drives people otherwise eager to help to rudeness and frustration.\n\nLastly, when posting, **please be focused and detailed**. Provide the recipe, your technique and exact procedures you followed and ask a question as specific as possible. The better your question is, the better our answers can be.\n\nIn terms of comments, while we are not a \u201cpros-only\u201d community, we do have a standard of what comments are appropriate, much like \/r\/askscience has. Firstly, we are a more \u201cserious\u201d subreddit than most.** Jokes, memes, puns and off-topic comments will be removed.** All comments must be accurate, well informed and either answer the questions fully, or add interesting discussion to the topic at hand. If your comment does not fulfill these goals, it will be removed**. Short, misinformed or vague responses are not appropriate here.**\n\nWe hope you realize why these rules are necessary and need to be enforced.

That meant the both pirate ships tried to board each other on the way to the HE grenade, and often someone got stranded on the other ship and had to be rescued by his captain.\n\nI also made a SAW (the movie) inspired map with many psychological puzzles that were very entertaining to play at LAN parties.\n\nExample: a room has a box that you need to be boosted up to. Up there is a button and a rifle. The button opens the next room, in which there's a dangerous path one player can take to allow all others to pass safely. If no one risks taking that dangerous path then they all need to take a semi-dangerous path.\n\nWhat often ended up happening was that the person who got the gun in the previous room forced one player to go the dangerous path to then pass safely himself.

I had never had a \"good\" sexual experience. I had been laid but nothing that i knew it could be. I decided that this could help my confidence and keep my going strong when I was having sex, as i had had problems of moderate ED in certain sexual situations that i was positive were linked to nerves and lack of confidence. Confidence that I was constantly diminishing with the porn i watched.\n\nI have not fapped or even glanced at any porn for nearly two months and i have made some massive strides. I met a girl who I fell in love with and I couldn't be happier with her.

Since nofap, and meeting her, I have watched *everything* in my life just **get better**.\n\n Promoted at my job, stronger and healthier than ever in the weightroom, starting to get back on the mat after a few months of absence (BJJ), and finding myself being able to put up with\/get along with my crazy family when I am home.

People do not recognize the usefulness of Thunderfocus tea, which allows us to renew all of our Renewing Mists on players. Uplift is insane if you can get the chi procs from soothing mist or jab.  Spinning crane kick is shit now though, and is only useful on burn phases where it's feasable to stack.  The mana cost is simply too high, with little return on Chi.\n\nTank healing is decent. Life Cocoon is an amazing CD, but it's hard to figure out when to use it unless your tank is extremely vocal about cooldown rotations. Surging mist is a mana dump, so it needs to be avoid at all costs unless you feel like going for the free surge from spamming tiger palm. (not worth it seriously, the jab cost is insane high). Enveloping Mists is a great heal, but you need to grab the chi for it extremely fast if it's needed. Generally I can get soothing mist to proc enough for it.\nTLDR; Monks need to keep tanks topped off at all times to be at all viable. Cocoon is the only mana efficient recovery method.\n\nUtiity is shit. Revival is a nice cooldown, but it's sudden, and it's used to keep the lowest in health from death. At times, that means overhealing others by 33%. \n\nSingle target healing is extremely viable. Far better than healing wave, heal, etc. It can't overheal. It's almost impossible.\n\n\nPLaying a monk properly is a huge skill gap. You need to manage a lot of different mechanics, and mana consumption is one of them.

If so, why?\n\nI'll refrain from selecting one work in particular, but I'd like to talk about Masaccio's works. They are some of the most important pieces historically, in my opinion, because they were the first to represent the re-discovery of linear perspective. Possibly inspired by the mathematical theories of the architect Brunelleshi, Masaccio was the first painter since antiquity to accurately paint with linear and 3D perspective. Though we see artists trying to make [forms](http:\/\/www.virtualuffizi.com\/uffizi\/img\/445.jpg) appear 3D with [shading](http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/b\/bf\/14th-century_unknown_painters_-_The_Osnabr%C3%BCck_Altarpiece_%28detail%29_-_WGA23756.jpg) and other tricks, [this](http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/9\/9b\/The_Wilton_Diptych_%28Right%29.jpg) half-realistic and still mostly Gothic style remains until the end of the 14th century. Once Masaccio rolls into town with his works such as [Holy Trinity](http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/d2\/Masaccio,_trinit%C3%A0.jpg\/300px-Masaccio,_trinit%C3%A0.jpg) (1425) and [Madonna and Child](http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/b\/be\/Madonna_Masaccio.jpg\/300px-Madonna_Masaccio.jpg) (1426), things start changing fast in the art world. Word of this new perspective travels fast to other artists who begin to copy his style. It only takes another 70 or so years before artists are producing Renaissance masterpieces such as Raphael's [The School of Athens](http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/9\/94\/Sanzio_01.jpg). You can compare and see for yourselves how rapidly realism in painting was achieved once linear perspective was re-discovered. In summary: if artists in the middle ages hadn't re-discovered classical thought (including math and science), modern art might today be much flatter and less interesting. ;)","score_com":2,"title":"Monday Mish-Mash | Visual Art in\/and History","selftext":"Previously:\n\n- [Beverages and Drinking](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/14zrml\/monday_mishmash_beverages_and_drinking\/)\n\n- [The Treatment of the Dead](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/13gdvg\/monday_mishmash_the_treatment_of_the_dead\/)\n\n- [School and Education](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/13284v\/monday_mishmash_school_and_education\/)\n\n- [The Human Body](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/12o417\/monday_mishmash_the_human_body\/)\n\n- [Ships and Sea Travel](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/129x3e\/monday_mishmash_ships_and_sea_travel\/)\n\n- [Historic Firsts and Lasts](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11wbeu\/monday_mishmash_historic_firsts\/)\n\n- [History on Film](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/11icba\/monday_mishmash_history_on_film\/)\n\n- [Historians](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/10rnl9\/monday_mishmash_historians\/)\n\n- [Naval Warfare](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/10e6wg\/monday_mishmash_naval_warfare\/)\n\n- [Fakes, Frauds and Hoaxes](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/1011jz\/monday_mishmash_fakes_frauds_and_hoaxes\/)\n\n- [Weaponry](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/zgiqx\/thursday_focus_weaponry\/)\n\n- [Historical Fiction](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/z2vaz\/thursday_focus_historical_fiction\/)\n\n- [World War II](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/yonze\/thursday_focus_world_war_ii\/)\n\n- [Crime and Criminals](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/yby8p\/thursday_focus_crimes_and_criminals\/)\n\n- [Animals, Beasts and Other Creatures](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/xxwhr\/thursday_focus_animals_beasts_and_other_creatures\/)\n\n- [The History of Music](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/xkn0h\/thursday_focus_the_history_of_music\/)\n\nAs has become usual, each Monday will see a new thread created in which users are encouraged to engage in general discussion under some reasonably broad heading.

What sort of concerns arise in examining that depiction?\n- The involvement of visual artists in the shaping of historical ideas and consciousness.\n- Artists who, in a more general sense, have had historically significant lives or careers.\n- Finally, though this is a bit of a synthesis of much of the above, I include it as its own bullet point to get the idea in people's heads: **Is there a particular image of or from your period that you find particularly important or potent?

It thus denounces the [Maoism] at its origin. But this denunciation remains [Maoist] \u2014 arbitrary, unexplained, and subject to continual modification \u2014 because **the ideological lie at its origin can never be revealed. The bureaucracy cannot liberalize itself either culturally or politically because its existence as a class depends on its ideological monopoly, which, for all its cumbersomeness, is its sole title to power**. This ideology has lost the passion of its original expression, but its passionless routinization still has the repressive function of controlling all thought and prohibiting any competition whatsoever. **The bureaucracy is thus helplessly tied to an ideology that is no longer believed by anyone**. The power that used to inspire terror now inspires ridicule, but this ridiculed power still defends itself with the threat of resorting to the terrorizing force it would like to be rid of. Thus, at the very time when the bureaucracy hopes to demonstrate its superiority on the terrain of capitalism it reveals itself to be a poor cousin of capitalism. Just as its actual history contradicts its fa\u00e7ade of legality and its crudely maintained ignorance contradicts its scientific pretensions, so its attempt to vie with the bourgeoisie in the production of commodity abundance is stymied by the fact that such abundance contains its own implicit ideology, and is generally accompanied by the freedom to choose from an unlimited range of spectacular pseudoalternatives \u2014 a pseudofreedom that remains incompatible with the bureaucracy\u2019s ideology.\n\n[Guy Debord, *Society of the Spectacle*, Thesis 110](http:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/guy-debord-the-society-of-the-spectacle#toc115)","score_com":0,"title":"Why does China even bother calling itself communist anymore?","selftext":"It's just state capitalism.

I've only started exploring and reading about this area for about 6 months now. However, I learned that visualizing can be extremely powerful in energy working, and have always been extremely adept at being able to visualize things and processes, and thus I realized how potent I could be with applying it to energy.\n\nThe areas that I'm interested in the most and would love to practice are telekinesis and healing. I also want to be able to read other people's energy aura and study how different things affect it, like mood ad environmental stimuli. I guess these are also the areas I could use the most improvement in since I haven't been able to do much at all with them! (More on why I haven't been able to below).\n\n2) I got involved in energy work through a natural process of connecting interests, curiosity and slight nagging at the idea that something like energy work existed; I just didn't have a name for it yet. I started by becoming interested in some aspects of the occult, but was disappointed that I couldn't find any groups that existed on sites that I already used. I then found the occult subreddit and then \/r\/energy_work and was delighted. \n\nAs I touched upon above, I think since a young age I've known 'something' was out there that was energy work, I just couldn't really put a definition and such to it. Since I got interested in energy work I've been more aware of myself and how I have subconsciously 'practicing' energy work for quite a bit longer than I was interested in it. Little things I would do in life suddenly made sense. I'm still a little unsure about some things to do with this, but a while back I started intuitively trying to pull energy in from around me, not necessarily from any source but I kept doing it. If I did this enough I would get a tingling feeling in the middle of my forehead and a large uplifting sensation in the middle of my chest. Still not too sure what that could be doing, any commentary would be nice.\n\nThe most significant experience I've had with energy work came several months ago. For context, I have a fairly large dog that is deathly afraid of thunderstorms. Every time there is one, he gets visibly upset, extremely timid and whines a bunch. He will usually try to hide somewhere he deems safe, like under a table or in a closet. I feel bad for him, but one day I'm trying to calm him down and then instinctively put my hand on his head. I visualized his fear as tiny dark parts of his mind scattered all over, and my hand was a magnet of sorts to it. I 'pulled' the bits from him and gathered them in my hand and then blasted them away from me in fear that they could affect him again if I just left them laying about. After I was done I felt pretty silly, confused to why I even started in the first place. However, the immediate effects took me by surprise. He became instantly calm and active, not being afraid anymore. He then kept trying to lick my hands and show affection when I went about my business afterwards like he knew I did something to help him and was appreciative. I think that has definitely been my most memorable experience thus far, especially since it came without any practice or much knowledge of the subject. Reading through this I feel quite silly again for posting, but I figure if there is a good time and place to discuss it, it would be here.\n\n3) In terms of texts, I can't really recommend any. If I find any I'll be sure to let you guys know!\n\nNow the reason I can't practice much at all. I live on campus at my school with a bunch of friends in my apartment, and everyone has someone they share the room with (yeah I'm aware that it sucks, but not much I can do about it haha). My suite has some degree of noise going on at all times so I can't meditate without being distracted, and for telekinesis specifically I would like to start with a psi wheel, but would have a hard time explaining why I'm staring at this paper wheel all day. In short, my roommates would not be very receptive to this sort of stuff, so I try not to talk about anything related to this much. I recently found some quiet spots in my school that I could use in peace, so hopefully that will be enough to get me started.\n\nWhew, that was quite the post, but I gave as much as I could think of so I hope it was somewhat interesting.","score_com":5,"title":"Community Discussion - Your own experiences and talents","selftext":"Hey everyone,\n\nI am trying to get more into working with energy and am looking for advice for the beginner and tips or tricks.\n\nWe all know the area of energy work has multiple applications and can be done in several different ways (from telekinsesis to healing to name a few).

Let me remind you that Roman Catholics already believe in a \"Purgatory\" which serves this purpose, and Hell is simply the \"punishment\" area. \n      Source:  \"To die in mortal sin without repenting and accepting God's merciful love means remaining separated from him for ever by our own free choice. This state of definitive self-exclusion from communion with God and the blessed is called \"hell.\"- Pope John Paul II, in 1992, in \"The Catechism of the Catholic Church.\"\n\nI believe I know why this argument has surfaced, despite historical precedent; it is a way for Christians to hand-wave away the arguments about whether we actually have free will independent from God or not. \n\nIn the past, Hell was used as a way to scare the malleable minds of children into obeying their elders and their religion. It was also used as a way to justify a superiority complex about people who don't follow their own moral codes. Now, with the advent of increased communications and study of the human psyche, we see that people's actions and moral codes are more a result of the social context and moral code they are raised in, which raises a problem for Christians: why would God punish someone for simply obeying the norms and moral codes that they were raised in, while simultaneously rewarding others for following the Christian-centric moral codes of their civilization?\n\nTheir solution? To claim that God doesn't actually \"punish\" anyone, He merely corrects their viewpoints in Hell and then welcomes them into his arms. A feel-good explanation, to be sure, but one that is 100% not supported in Catholicism (source: my strict upbringing, the words of the Pope, and general historical teachings), and not one supported by most other denominations either, as far as I can tell.\n\nI would love to hear Christians' opinions on these thoughts, and I would also love to see any sources of these claims of a relatively \"nice\" Hell being supported historically.

And I think you found others speaking up for such a thing in other posts. Its just the majority is a much louder, and more numbered so they will more likely be online and have something to say. We the minority may not speak up here, but weall have shown our interest in your idea in other threads. The thing is, there is already r\/truechildfreedom which you can subscribe to. If the minority were to subscribe it would be nice, but idk how much more media the sub would get. Its worth a shot tho. Im tired of hearing about bad parenting on a childfree forum.","score_com":-2,"title":"[Meta]Open Dialogue with the Mods","selftext":"Ok guys so here goes...\n\nAfter [this No. 1 post](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/childfree\/comments\/15q9sk\/is_this_subreddit_for_people_not_wanting_kids_or\/) and the ensuing discussion, I'd like to try and open a dialogue regarding the direction this subreddit is going and hopefully get a better feel for what the mods\/community want out of r\/childfree.\n\nWhen I first started coming here I found this place very insightful and it was very meaningful to me to have a place where liked minded folks shared so openly.  We've grown since then and with that growth comes an ever changing landscape.  \n\nWhat brought me here were thought provoking discussions like [\"How much has the possibility of having a child with a disability or mental illness factored into your decision ro be childfree\"](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/childfree\/comments\/15p30g\/how_much_has_the_possibility_of_having_a_child\/) and [\"Considering adopting the childfree lifestyle, but a common question plagues me\"](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/childfree\/comments\/15ql5g\/considering_adopting_the_childfree_lifestylee_but\/)\n\nHowever, recently (as is typical of a growing subreddit) we have seen more and more \"circlejerk\" type posts such as [\"Nightmare and 30,000 Feet\"](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/childfree\/comments\/15p8ej\/nightmare_at_30000_feet_xpost_from_rhistoryporn\/) and [\"I was waiting to get my haircut and got to witness this for 15 minutes\"](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/childfree\/comments\/15qgjl\/i_was_waiting_to_get_my_haircut_and_got_to\/)\n\nNow, I do not mean to speak for everyone, but the general consensus I took away from the comments in susurro's post (and the resulting PMs to my response) is that the latter wasn't particularly welcome and the former is very much missed and no one wants this place to become r\/atheism. \n\nI would propose you create an additional subreddit and separate the lifestyle discussions from the memes\/rants\/whathaveyou.  This allows the subscriber to pick what they like and will limit one preference to steam roll over the other (people always have the option to sub to both if they like the way CF is now).  Just some food for thought - Thanks for your time.\n\n****************************************************************\nEDIT:  Alright folks, I've never been the type too proud to admit I was wrong.  Given the comments and votes I clearly misinterpreted a vocal minority to be the majority.  Thanks to everyone who contributed to the discussion and have a happy New Year.","score":0},"109":{"subreddit":"diablo3","id":"15pyhl","comment_body":"Hey, 1.1k hours barb player here.\n\nThere are many things you can improve. Your skill setup especially.\n\nRight now, you have :\n\n- 2 AoE abilities\n- 0 single target damage\n- 0 escape\n- only 1 active damage skill at a time (either WW or cleave)\n- low\/risky (because CD) regen\n\nDo you really need WW ? If yes then why ?\n\n- To ignore unit collision ? Leap or Furious Charge can do that job AND provide you a much better escape (in case you get walled, vortexed into frozen, need to run away fast, etc.)\n- For AoE damage, as a fury spender ? Try Rend (ravage \/ bloodlust), it will give you high AoE damage (and even regen if you use bloodlust). On top of that, once you're done with the animation, you can use other skills for more damage. The more spells active at a time, the better.\n\nAre Maraudeur's Rage \/ lifesteal Ignore Pain that good ? Over Revenge - provocation  (AoE + heal) ? Over an escape tool ?\n\nIs cleave that good ? Why ?\n\n- AoE ? If you use rend and revenge, white trash will melt.\n- Single target damage ? Mistake then, because Frenzy is much better for that (bonus : maniac increases rend\/revenge damage, sidearm procs life on hit and provides a small boost to your AoE damage).\n\nNow, about your regen. You based it on lifesteal, which is not optimal imo when you're only at 40k damage. Lifesteal suffers a 80% nerf in inferno, which makes it pretty bad if you dont have really high damage. Get high life on hit and attack speed.\n\nOne last thing, have you considered getting a [Thunder God's Vigor](http:\/\/www.d3lexicon.com\/item\/thunder-gods-vigor) ? The melee reduction on that belt is pretty strong. You can get a cheap 18+% one for 100k (yes, in the HC ah). \n38k is pretty good i think. I cleared inferno 2 days ago with a bit less than 20k dps (then switched to ww). \n\nhttp:\/\/eu.battle.net\/d3\/en\/profile\/Ciriath-2833\/hero\/22019363\n\nPS : about your passives, you may want to use superstition and the other armor passive vs act III monsters. The succubus debuff only applies to your base armor, and do not remove 50% of your bonus armor. Therefore, you can +\/- counter it by stacking bonus armor passives.\n\nI cleared Inferno pretty easily using triple def passives (inspiring presence over tough as nails until act III succubus), and frenzy + rend + revenge. With 20k, i never felt like my damage was lacking.","score_com":1,"title":"Need suggestion on how to make my Barb60(13) better","selftext":"So im halfway thru inferno atm. \nIm doing okay I guess, sometimes I have a \"oh shit\" moment but rarely go bellow 25% hp. I feel that my dmg is really low, 38k unbuffed. I manage Act 2 without a hassle with this damage but would obviously like to raise it more. When I go exploring the Auction House I have a really hard time deciding if something really is worth it and then notice after buying that it will just lower all my stats even when it looked awesome in the AH.  My weapon isn't the best one but I have been unable to find anything quite like it with life steal and str vit in the amounts that it have. \n\nThanks for any input :) \n\nhttp:\/\/eu.battle.net\/d3\/en\/profile\/nugge-2703\/hero\/22238115","score":0},"110":{"subreddit":"GunsAreCool","id":"15qmm5","comment_body":"That was my post...and after getting slammed for the quality of the pictures and the fact that the guns were on the bed and not posed on a museum quality display taken by a $5000 professional DSLR, I deleted the post.  *Almost snapped*, but then remembered that I'm sane, have a good life, and generally like people.\n                     \nThe comments were not uplifting, and I certainly didn't stand tall with pride after reading them, but hell this is Reddit and no one should come here looking for compliments.
