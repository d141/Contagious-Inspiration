# Contagious-Inspiration

This is a combination project for the Data Science MS program at Indiana University. The project applies to two classes: Social Media Mining and Natural Language Processing.

The first step was to replicate the models built here: https://paperswithcode.com/paper/detecting-inspiring-content-on-social-media

The second step was examine differences in comment similarities under inspiring posts and not inspiring posts.

My hypothesis was that due to Redditors being 'inspirationally primed', I'd find a Bandwagon Effect in the comment threads underneath inspiring posts. That is, subsequent top-level comments would be similar to the top-voted, top-level comment.

I did not find a stastically significant result that supports this hypothesis. However, it is still my intuition that there's something here.

My next step will be to use the models I trained to select new posts, rather than using the posts supplied by Ognat et al.
